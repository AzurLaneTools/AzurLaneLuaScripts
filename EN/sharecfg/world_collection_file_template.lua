One example is the mysterious ■■■■■■ Explosion that occurred in Northern Parliament territory. \nOn ■■/■■/■■■■ at daybreak, there was a huge explosion comparable to a nuclear detonation in the western part of the Northern Parliament, completely destroying a forested region of greater than 20■■ square kilometers. The cause of this mysterious explosion has attracted the attention of countless scientists and scholars for a century. Though many hypotheses have been proposed, no consensus has been reached by the academic community, and this case remains an unresolved historical mystery. \nJust when the world had begun to slowly forget about it, scientists made shocking progress in recent days by relying on the cutting-edge technology to re-explore the ancient ■■■■■■ area. The latest research has brought forth a famous hypothesis that gets ever closer to the truth behind the explosion: The Aerolith Hypothesis......"

…After an investigation, it was concluded that the massive explosion that occurred in Northern Parliament territory was most likely caused by a meteorite impact. This is generally consistent with the long-held Aerolith Hypothesis, but the actual situation is quite a bit different from what the hypothesis posited. 
The most suspicious aspect of the ■■■■■■ Explosion: 
At least three powerful explosions occurred simultaneously, and three craters were identified. However, no meteorite fragments were found at the scene. 
Though the Aerolith Hypothesis can explain the incident to some extent, this piece of evidence is what prevented this theory from being broadly accepted. However, the latest research finally proposed a reasonable explanation to what happened to the meteorite fragments. 
Research showed that meteorites that hit the earth first broke up into several pieces due to mesospheric friction, thus forming three separate explosion craters. Additionally, according to calculations, the three impact sites in the ■■■■■■ region may only represent the impact points of some of these fragments; other meteorites whose orbits were changed during atmospheric entry have a high probability of having fallen into the polar regions. Due to the special qualities of these meteorite fragments, they may have quickly “melted” into the surrounding environment. Therefore, the actual fragments have not been found at the impact sites, resulting in the mystery that still persists today...]]

However, following this paper, countless reporters, researchers, explorers, and tourists from all over the league flocked to the forest where the meteorite impacts remain. 
According to customs officials, over the last three months, the number of scientific research entry applications increased more than a hundred times compared to the same period in previous years, with all other types of applications also increasing significantly.

The Summit designated the official international name of the Energy Cube as “ε-Cube” and also provided a series of standards for its production and utilization. 
Unlike with conventional energy sources, the most important thing about producing ε-Cubes is the construction of a complex synthetic container. Differences in specifications during the production process of this container will directly affect the quality of the resulting ε-Cube. At the Summit, scientists carried out extensive discussions of the experimental data published by various countries, finally formulating a series of standards to produce a stable and reliable ε-Cube. These standards will serve as a general specification for the production and utilization of ε-cubes across the world.

...Waste disposal and recycling have been one of humanity's hardest-to-solve problems for years. As the chemical compounds that form a cornerstone of our modern society grow increasingly complex, the primitive method of disposing of them in landfills starts to become infeasible, while microbes capable of decomposing waste products are unable to satisfy even a tiny fraction of global demand. Recycling, meanwhile, is crippled by its elaborate and costly sorting processes, and thus the percentage of waste being recycled globally has remained low.

At present, the most popular waste disposal method is concentrated incineration in special-made compartments. This allows for the maximum amount of energy possible to be extracted from the waste. Afterwards, the residue goes through several steps of processing, including one step wherein metal components are retrieved and collected.
Regardless, due to the sheer number of Cube energy farms that have been constructed, waste-burning energy production has become a high-cost, low-profit industry. As a result, we face a dilemma where more and more waste treatment facilities are forced to close down, even though we need them.

There is a silver lining, however. Cubes created this conundrum, but they can also solve it. As Cubes are a practically free energy source,

...Cubes, being a compact energy source, were seemingly the perfect solution to the power supply question faced by many engineers working on Powered Combat Suit (PCS) projects around the world. Tests have showed the Cubes not only extend a PCS's maximum operational time, they also provide it with enhanced mobility and an astounding increase in speed.
Due to the limitations of last-generation energy supply solutions, old PCS models were semi-open designs created to be as lightweight as possible. As these models were unable to provide their user with full-body protection, they only saw extremely limited usage.
After the breakthroughs of Cube technology, this fundamental problem became all but a non-issue. PCS design has undergone a complete reversal with the latest generation, with most models favoring a casing that fully encloses the operator. These suits put emphasis on increased firepower and armor, life-support for missions in hazardous environments, and systems that raise the operator's tactical awareness. The PCS, once merely an auxiliary combat aide, has transformed into a literal war machine.
This rapid development has sparked debate among engineers over the PCS's fundamental design, however. Some argue the bipedal model designed around the human body is here to stay, while others propose switching to wheeled vehicle-type designs featuring superior stability. Others still ponder the feasibility of leveraging the Cubes' almost inexhaustible energy to create suits with "wings"...]]

...The FNH Group's new model of heavy machine gun, the FNCB4, has passed inspection and is scheduled for adoption by the military soon. The FNCB4 has an integrated miniature Cube which continuously provides the weapon's other components with energy. This grand departure from long-standing HMG design tradition allowed for many innovations that take advantage of the Cube technology's abundant energy, such as kinetic energy accelerators embedded in the barrel, and a ballistic trajectory correction device built into in the weapon's sights, among others.

The HMG can be further categorized into one of 8 models based on intended use, most notably:
- FNCB4A, for use by infantry
- FNCB4B, for use in Powered Combat Suits
- FNCB4F, for use by large drones
- FNCB4H, for use on unmanned warships

7 out of 8 models cleared all tests; testing of model FNCB4B has been postponed due to a malfunction with the testing platform. The remaining 7 models are all slated to enter mass-production.
The FNH Group's most high-profile weapons project, a high-energy laser weapon powered by Cube technologies, did not make an appearance at this round of testing. When asked about this, the public relations manager at FNH Group informed us the weapon is still in the testing phase...]]

...The Northern Parliament will once again be sending their tried and tested nuclear-powered space shuttle on a resupply mission to Space Station Emir. The shuttle will be delivering the regular cargo consisting of food supplies and research equipment, in addition to 3 medium-sized supplementary Cube power units.
Once they have been successfully installed, these units will then provide the station's existing installations with additional output.

The Northern Parliament intends to install additional Cube power units on the station in the future and further expand the Emir's operational scope.
Additionally, a Northern Parliament space program representative announced that plans are in the works to construct a new docking platform that would allow the station to store and launch probes into deep-space. These probes are currently under development and will be powered with Cube technology.

Upon review of both nuclear-powered and Cube-powered space shuttles for use in low-Earth orbit, scientists found that Cube-powered shuttles do not have any significant advantages over their older nuclear-powered counterparts. In light of these findings, many organizations have announced plans to invest research into Cube-powered deep-space probes that can take off directly from space station docking platforms instead...]]

More like they're rolling out a testbed of a converted light tank. The specs are all classified, so it's anyone's guess how it actually performs in combat. It's pretty much the same size based on the pics they've released to the public so far too, so my educated guess is the only major change is the new compact cube engine is gonna open up space and improve crew comfort.

...This article provides information about the "ECHO Plan" recently unveiled by the X.O.S. Chamber of Commerce. Based on the published materials, the "ECHO Plan" is divided into three stages, but so far only the first two have been disclosed publicly.
In the first stage, the Chamber of Commerce will mobilize R&D resources and talent to achieve breakthroughs in Cube technology and applications in the aviation sector. Currently, Cube-powered engines can only be used in large stationary machines and small to medium-sized ground vehicles. If this development goes smoothly, engines for large drones will be developed first, followed by engines for passenger planes and freight, then finally, engines for combat aircraft. Imagine the joys of flying without a need to refuel.
The completion of the first stage of the plan will revolutionize the traditional aviation industry, leaving tanker aircraft behind in history. In the second phase, following on the success of Cube-powered aircraft engines, the Chamber of Commerce plans to develop Cube-powered rockets for near-Earth orbital transport and deep space exploration.

The end result is not as efficient or as clean as a pure E-Cube engine, and it is also harder to maintain. However, the installation process is far simpler and less time-consuming. This greatly reduces the structural hurdles such as having the necessary equipment and technical personnel, and is more compatible with dated fleets. It is possible to modernize an entire fleet in a short period of time."

"It's hard to say. We're trying to push the limits of combat capabilities through technology, but there are differences in how E-Cubes are applied. Of course, our Enterprise, powered solely through E-Cubes, will undoubtedly be the mightiest carrier in the world after retrofitting is finished.

A Royal Navy representative concluded the summit with the following statement:

"The arrival of Energy Cubes changed the face of our world forever. With their vast range of applications, we managed to solve all our food and energy problems at the fundamental level.

But, as many people have suspected, not all things these Cubes brought into existence have been good. As a matter of fact, we are on the verge of a crisis of an unprecedented scale. Our enemies have weaponised the Energy Cubes. They have set up countless test facilities to conduct research on the Cubes, and they are trying to use the Cubes' vast range of applications as a weapon to destroy us!

Faced with this regretable fact, what other choice do we have but to move forward with an Energy Cube weapons programme of our own? If our enemy intends to strike us, we must be prepared to strike them back"...]]

We understand what they do, but not how they do it. That isn't to say nobody has done any research – oh no, quite the opposite. Countless hours of research have been sunk into production methods and ways to increase energy efficiency. It is the fundamental workings of the Cubes which anyone has yet to try to explain.

Megacorporations have set up who knows how many research labs dedicated to these blue miracle-makers, but the scope of their research is limited solely to Cubes as an energy source. Their only objective is to create a Cube that's more energy-efficient than the last.

My research, meanwhile, has found evidence that Cubes are so much more than just souped-up batteries. Their use as an energy source is only the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, the many mysteries they hold will take time and effort to unravel.
I wish to prove my theory to the world. In order to do that, I will need additional funding, and your authorization.

The incident began a few days ago. Aircraft carrier Enterprise is slated to undergo extensive maintenance for 36 months at the SD Naval Base, but immediately upon its arrival, the admiral was to leave the base to participate in meetings with the naval leadership.
Initially, our journalists were planning to ask the admiral about the impact of Cube-powered warships on global affairs and what this maintenance would bring to the Enterprise during a normal press conference. However, even though the press conference was in full swing, the admiral was absent without prior notice despite being scheduled to attend! While the press conference itself concluded without further issue, we followed some suspicious leads and conducted our own investigation for a few days. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that the admiral had gone missing!
After entering the Department of Defense building, the admiral seemed to have "disappeared" from the building without a trace, and there were no traces of him leaving. We weren't going to give up, so we contacted the colonel's wife, who unfortunately declined our interview.

…As of the time of this report, Phase I of testing has already been completed.

During Phase I of the project, our team focused on optimizing the power supply and expanding the functionality of the ε-Cube. So far, military-grade ε-Cubes have seen a 312% increase in power output, 76% increase in stability, and a 20% reduction in volume compared to the previous specification. 

Though these specifications are quite different from the international standard, we nevertheless consider this model to be the most suitable for military usage among the variations currently being researched. We also have made significant breakthroughs in its application to military armaments, the details which have been omitted here but can be found in the addendum to this report. These application studies have been handed to the working group, which will continue subsequent research into that subject. Our team instead has transitioned into Phase II: identifying how ε-Cubes are capable of generating energy.

To our knowledge, many parties are already carrying out similar lines of research, though no breakthroughs have been made on this front. While it is possible that their research has yielded no fruit, we cannot rule out the possibility that information is being withheld to stymie the efforts of other researchers.

Regardless, we plan to do away with any speculation and return to studying the building blocks of the ε-Cube at a sub-atomic level. However, our current facilities do not meet the conditions that would allow us to advance our research in the way outlined above. Therefore, we would like to apply for two things: First, that a new lab be established in the Somers Isle in the Bermuda Triangle capable of satisfying our equipment, environmental, and confidentiality needs, and second, that permission to view the confidential research materials of "Project Dusk" be granted.

...Our team went back to the point of origin to try to reproduce the environment in which the ε-Cube was first born, unlike modern manufacturing settings in which Cubes can be produced stably. Under these environments, though the strength and stability of power output fluctuated dramatically, I was able to observe a point that could be considered the "birth" of an ε-Cube many times. As long as there are no requirements on the power output, the number of possible configurations for ε-Cubes do not merely number in the dozens. Though there is likely plenty of room for improvement, I do believe that from a military standpoint, the ε-Cubes currently in use are already closest to the optimal configuration.

It is worth noting that throughout the experiment, the ε-Cubes did not generate power in a continuous manner. Energy production would change from a 0 to a 1 only after certain conditions were met, similar to flipping a light switch.

In a sense, this phenomenon is similar to the relationship between potential and kinetic energy. However, the ε-Cube does not explicitly act upon any matter in the process of generating power, nor does it lose mass. None of the physical principles we currently have adequately explained the functionality of the ε-Cube.

To continue the next phase of research, I would like permission to view all of the research data from the now-frozen "Polar Analysis" project.

...Experiments to extract energy from the ε-Cube are still ongoing. As we expected, the energy "contained" within an ε-Cube is literally inexhaustible, whether through civilian or military use, and the service life of an ε-Cube is determined not by the amount of energy it contains, but rather by the properties of the materials that go into the Cube. We came to the conclusion that the most important determinant is the durability of the materials. In essence, this is the exact opposite of nuclear fission.

From our experimental results, should there be some material that can withstand long-term usage, ε-Cubes should be able to provide energy continuously without any external input, akin to a perpetual motion machine. Additionally, the quality of the ε-Cube affects its power output, something that is already widely known.

Further evidence exists to support my hypothesis: that the ε-Cube is a device that extracts energy, rather than produces it. Beyond the mechanics of the Cube itself, I do not particularly care what the true origins or nature of this energy are. While I could make some educated guesses, that would fly in the face of scientific principles and common sense itself. All that matters is that we continue our research. For that purpose, it would be very helpful if ALL the data from the "Polar Analysis" project be made available...

...The results of the experiment are unbelievable. If we eliminate every impossible hypothesis one by one, we must accept the last one remaining, no matter how unbelievable it may seem. With the belief that it is in fact true, my team has worked ceaselessly to test all hypotheses until finally, we have arrived at the truth. I can say with certainty that the energy source of the ε-Cube must exist in a higher dimensional space, separate from the space-time we exist in.

All our experiments have pointed to the same conclusion over and over. The energy from an ε-Cube comes from a higher dimensional space that has always been theorized to exist, but could never be proven because there was no way to observe it. The ε-Cube acts like a transducer, continuously converting the energy stored in the higher dimension and outputting it in a usable form in our dimension, therefore acting like a perpetual motion machine that defies the laws of physics.

Even though we produced and utilized the ε-Cube, we had no idea how it worked... until now. Though this is a revolutionary breakthrough, I can't help but think about how that higher-dimension space came to exist. If the theory that higher-dimension space can house an infinite number of lower-dimension spaces, and lower-dimension space can be observed, then by applying these theories... ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■...

...After thoroughly analyzing all the data left in the Polar Decompilation project, our team has made remarkable progress in studying the material compositions of ε-Cubes.

At first, it was believed that only a sturdy and stable material could be made into a durable ε-Cube – that is, the ε-Cube would inherit the properties of the material itself.

Naturally, that belief is common sense in our world. For example, a bowl made of wood has the same properties as wood. A bowl made of paper would also have the same properties as paper. As such, anyone could tell you that a bowl of wood is sturdier than a bowl of paper. However, this common sense does not apply to ε-Cubes, and until now, all the research on materials has been nothing more than trial and error based upon a faulty notion of common sense.

The ε-Cube does not inherit the properties of the materials used to make it, but rather changes based upon those materials. Simply put, an ε-Cube is more than the sum of the components used to make it. Whether wood or paper, the properties of the Cube are not completely related to the physical properties of the components. Of course, neither wood nor paper are suitable materials for the construction of an ε-Cube shell, but with this knowledge, we once again open ourselves to countless new possibilities worth trying, such as ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■...

...With this, Phase II of our research has been completed. The derivative cube, tentatively named "Chokhmah," has proven many of the hypotheses outlined in previous reports.

So far, our research has already accomplished what it initially sought out to do: determine the ε-Cube's true energy source. However, because our results were so unexpected, the mysteries behind the ε-Cube have only grown deeper. So plagued am I by doubts about the existence of this higher dimension of energy that I cannot even feel joy at the truth that was just uncovered.

In light of these findings, it is necessary to review the research results obtained from Phase I of the project. I've decided to leave this to another team.

As for Phase III... That is, the study of this higher-dimensional space, my team will analyze this unknown space, deepen our understanding of it, re-examine the very framework of the reality we live in, and perhaps, even prove ■■■■■■...

I would like to apply for a tour of Project Dusk's testing grounds. Our research will surely prove useful for Project Dusk, and I am curious about the implications that Code G's existence has for our future research...

...The experiment finally worked! After so many twists and turns, I was starting to doubt if we were even on the right track... but I'm so glad we stuck it through to the very end! I initially posited that ε-Cube was much more than just an energy source that would advance technology in human society, and the research results proved that I was correct.

(Dr. Aoste's research was very helpful. I'll have to bring him a thank-you present...)

Umm... "By improving the materials, we succeeded in creating a variant of the ε-Cube... We didn't have a name for it, but after doing some research and getting feedback from the other team members..." Yeah, let's go with "Wisdom Cube." I like the sound of that!

Let's see... Next is... "In a special environment adjusted from the previous iteration of experiments, by applying a controlled amount of stimulation to the ε-Cube, we were able to induce a resonance reaction with the materials in the same environment and maintain stability without interference by the Cube's complex fluctuations. From this, we witnessed an entirely new intelligent entity born from the ε-Cube."

Hmm... I'm not sure "born" is the right word to use here. The materials around the ε-Cube all disappeared, so in other words... "Rather than being created from nothing, the particles of the matter were rearranged and reassembled due to reaching a certain resonance between the ε-Cube and the various materials." ...From an outside perspective, all of this may appear to be encroaching on the realm of God, but as a researcher, and as a director of this project, it's my job to explain this phenomenon in scientific terms...

...As for the naming issue, from a management standpoint, all experimental products require some kind of code number for identification purposes, but this is truly a unique case... At the agency's urging, I finally decided on the name "Code G" and announced it at today's meeting.

So from now on, her name is Code G, Singularity G, or just "G" if you prefer something shorter. As for me, I like the idea of giving her a name just like a real human, so I call her "Enterprise." After all, the idea of calling a person by a code is just... Well, I hope I can get the other staff members to see her as human as well.

So from now on, I'll write down some information about Enterprise every day.

Born with the body of a human female, the intelligent body "Enterprise" has an almost perfect grasp of our world's knowledge and language, as if it had come pre-installed in her head (because of this, everyone in the facility sees her as an overly diligent AI). On the other hand, her ability to live life like a normal human being seems rather lacking, and her mental age appears to also be... around that of a human middle schooler? Considering the rarity of Wisdom Cubes, we'll most likely be limited to simply observing her for the time being...

...As our observation continued, Enterprise's humanity became more and more evident.

So, first of all, her physiological characteristics are almost identical to that of a human: she eats the same food, breathes and sleeps like a human, and even shares most of the same vital signs. The primary difference is that unlike humans, her appearance and stature appears to be fixed. She doesn't gain weight no matter how much she eats, and her hair quickly returns to its original length no matter how much of it you cut off. I'm not sure if she can contract human illnesses, but at least during the time I spent with her, I never noticed her coming down with any common illnesses or getting colds. However, she does seem to have subjective sensations of feeling better or worse at times, and I've even seen her oversleep when tired.

Despite all this data and evidence to suggest that she absolutely is human, there are many staff members who remain convinced that she's nothing more than an advanced AI... Isn't that way of thinking way too rigid? I have to convince them otherwise. Maybe the "Wisdom" part of the Wisdom Cube is a good place to start...

...We recently perform a combat test. All this time, I'd viewed Enterprise as identical to a typical human girl. However, everything changed the moment she put on the special equipment created from the same Wisdom Cubes that birthed her.

This equipment massively enhanced Enterprise's physical capabilities. Her strength, stamina, agility, every measurable statistic received an astonishing increase. As for the equipment itself... They bear the appearance of mini-sized naval-grade cannons and machine guns, but the staggering firepower they possess left all the on-site research staff speechless.
Who wouldn't be? After all, this girl, who for all intents and purposes is no different to any ordinary human being, commands power to rival that of fully equipped warships...

I consulted with the agency, and we came to the joint conclusion to name this special equipment "rigging." Just like Enterprise herself, it was created by exposing large quantities of materials to Wisdom Cubes, causing a resonance reaction that rearranged and reassembled the materials. The materials were entirely consumed in this process, leaving behind only the rigging after the resonance reaction completed. One can't help but wonder where the bulk of the materials' mass went...

On another topic, I'd like to propose reassigning some staff to research this subject exclusively. I'll also need to bring up the potential military applications of our discovery to Dr. Aoste's team...

Why were there museum artifacts among the materials at the site where Enterprise was born? Did they just happen to be there? Or did someone intentionally leave them there? I can't construct an explanation for either theory.

Who is this "Enterprise" anyway? That, too, is anyone's guess. Not even she can provide a clear explanation as to why that is her name, or why she claims to be an aircraft carrier, or why she knows so much about the actual ship, the Enterprise. She has no recollection of any events prior to her birth, for that matter.
It is true that she and her rigging share some visual similarities with the warship of the same name, and furthermore, that her rigging follows human warship design conventions of the same period while also using the same components (albeit scaled-down). Of course, it would be ludicrous to conclude that this girl IS Enterprise based on this evidence.

Attempting to answer these questions is likely to only lead one down a philosophical rabbit hole.
After all, who am I? What makes me Dr. Anzeel? What makes Dr. Aoste into Dr. Aoste?

The famous Ship of Theseus thought experiment asks a similar question. If one were to gradually replace every part of the ship, would it still be the Ship of Theseus?
If it's not the individual parts that make the ship into what it is, then what does? What gives a ship its "soul," so to speak?

More pertinent to the topic at hand, what is it that gives Enterprise her soul?

...The results of our 7-day long naval exercise are astounding. We already knew that Code G's combat potential rivals that of a modern capital ship based on our theoretical estimates, but her actual capabilities were in fact beyond our wildest expectations.

Code G is able to enlarge her rigging to launch and pilot dozens if not hundreds of aircraft entirely by herself. The offensive potential of her rigging surpasses that of multiple older fleet carriers combined. The aircraft she launched were comparable in size to remote-control planes, but despite this, they had all the firepower of their full-scale counterparts.

Her mobility and size, too, put traditional warships to shame.
Being only the size of an adult human female, she is able to board a vessel and launch surprise attacks from the deck. Furthermore, despite what her human appearance might lead one to speculate, with her rigging equipped she suffered no damage from both small arms fire and from shockwaves caused by explosions.

Larger weapons similarly proved ineffective against Code G. With a profile smaller than even an unmanned patrol boat, it is practically impossible to land a hit on her using naval cannons. When torpedoes were fired at Code G, she leapt over them, and when an attempt was made to hit her using a guided missile, she made a sharp turn and dodged it.
Code G's group, consisting of her and a handful of destroyers, were able to hold their own against 2 entire aircraft carrier task forces. This is an unbelievable feat, made all the more so by the fact that: 1) she is only just beginning to accustom herself to her rigging, and 2) she has yet to fully master conventional tactics.

Code G's rigging enlarging warrants further investigation. She had not shown this ability prior to this exercise.
Her power to somehow reconstruct her rigging is also of particular interest. It could, perhaps, lead to an answer to the question of what happened to all the materials that vanished from the test site...

...announced that it will simultaneously hold a new round of worldwide naval strategic exercises on December 10th. This regular exercise, which has been conducted roughly every ■ years for some time now, is recognized as an important means of assessing the difference between countries' naval might.
However, because the exercises were scheduled several years before the regularly expected time period, military critics have claimed that this irregular event is an attempt to counter the joint exercises held by the Eagle Union and its allies.
Given the number of active warships in the Northern Parliament, experts estimate that over 800 warships will be participating in this exercise, an event of unprecedented scale.
From the previous exercises held ■ years ago, the world had already been flooded with the advent of Energy Cube technology and its derivative products, resulting in massive leaps in development across every faction. The Northern Parliament adapted in their own way, applying E-Cube technology in a completely different manner than the Eagle Union, successfully converting over 30% of their active fleet into being powered by E-Cubes, and this development will likely be the highlight of these naval exercises...
Of course, don't write off the possibility of a "surprise." Just as the Eagle Union once unveiled a new type of weapon without warning, the Northern Parliament may have something in store for the world at the end of this year...]]

...The new weapon, Code G, which looks like a human girl born from a Cube, dropped a bombshell on the scientific community. Almost immediately, researchers across all disciplines began to argue over the fundamental question of its humanity— after all, how should one see an entity such as Code G, artificially born from an object, the Cube?
Naturally, no conference or forum around this "new technology" can avoid this basic proposition. Once this debate begins, however, there seldom seems to be an end to it. ...Currently, there are two predominant mainstream ideas:
The first is widely supported among researchers in academia, including Dr. Anzeel, a well-known Cube researcher: Code G was not born from a generic "Energy Cube," but rather from a special "Wisdom Cube," and because of the various characteristics and actions that "she" represents, she cannot be strictly considered a weapon, but is a "sentient and intelligent being" just like humans. In other words, they are to be considered citizens of their respective nations and as such, have basic human rights.
Meanwhile, high-level government officials and some researchers prefer to define this new weapon as high-performance artificial intelligence. Weapons builts from objects are to be considered as the protected property of the organization they come from, and though they are not programmed, they are still limited by dedicated rules and laws similar to AI, and thus considered "human-created intelligence."
An Eagle Union spokesperson agreed with the latter argument, saying that "[the KAN-SEN] are merely combat weapons with high-performance artificial intelligence and therefore should be treated in the same manner as weapons in accordance to management regulations."

..."Rigging" is a general term used for the equipment worn by the new KAN-SEN weapons, much like the armament broadly used by warships. Similarly, KAN-SEN are classified into destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, etc., according to differences in their rigging.
Rigging is equipped with modules that have the same functions as normal armament, such as naval artillery, torpedoes, and radars. Most of these modules are, as their name implies, miniature versions of real-life weapons, but some seem like they come straight out of science fiction. Rigging cannot be operated by ordinary humans, but are considered indispensable for KAN-SEN. Only when equipped with rigging do KAN-SEN gain power comparable to a warship.
The first rigging, like the KAN-SEN, was believed to have been developed from a Wisdom Cube (likely an evolution of a military-grade E-Cube). However, as research progressed, it became clear that certain modules could be separated from the rigging and interchanged freely, and soon after the first KAN-SEN was built, alternative rigging modules and manufacturing techniques were discovered. Currently, the method of manufacturing rigging is kept confidential by each faction, so a civilian researcher like myself can only speculate, but... I can guess that the Wisdom Cube is still involved in the production of these modules.
Rigging maintenance and modernization play important roles in the upkeep of a KAN-SEN's combat capabilities. Future KAN-SEN technological competition will revolve around the R&D of these equipment modules...]]

If you believe the stories, Cubes will "resonate" when exposed to material under specific conditions, and create an android with very sophisticated artificial intelligence. Dr. Anzeel insists it's not an android, but organic life, but I have reason to doubt that.

…Its ability to learn is extraordinary. It has learned the basics of dozens of diverse sciences, ranging from social sciences, to humanities, to linguistics, to military theory. All in a short timeframe.

And that's not all. After every combat exercise, it writes its own reports, reviews its tactics, and adjusts its equipment, all on its own. Although it's on the whole not as efficient as a specialized military AI, it's able to make complicated decisions, and even appears to have original thoughts and ideas. These factors are what set it apart from all other currently available military AIs.

Personally, I have some qualms about dedicating precious time to making it study the liberal arts. Dr. Anzeel, however, asserts that doing so lets it more readily take in information and function in society at large. Sure, that's useful for espionage or fleeing a warzone to blend in with civilians, but considering the AI's expected service life, we should be focusing on more important things.

I do hope we'll get to perform a test of the AI's "rigging," as Dr. Anzeel called it, in the near future. It would be interesting to see what it's capable of...

…Code G demonstrated an outstanding ability to analyze the battlefield, issue commands, and of course, partake in the fighting itself during a joint exercise today.

More and more combat units of the same type as Code G have begun appearing recently. Their advantages over last-generation war machines are so numerous that the two are almost categorically uncomparable. They are even quicker to produce, too.

The scale of the lab's research grows with each passing day. The 3 facilities are situated on an island in a far-off corner of the sea. This remote location was ideal for ensuring secrecy during the project's first stage, though there is no longer any need to hide the existence of Code G and her sisters from the world.
At present, the combat units are engaged in logistics transports and combat exercises at an esteemed naval base. This base conducts round-the-clock research into new weapons and serves as a training ground.

One question regarding the combat units arose during their transfer into the navy – should the navy address them by their established codenames, or their "true" names? Dr. Anzeel posits the navy should use their "true" names, but Naval HQ disagrees on the matter, stating potential confusion arising from a combat unit having the same name as a warship in active service as their basis.
It will likely be long before any kind of verdict on the matter is reached...

Why? Because it symbolizes that the navy formally acknowledges Enterprise as an individual and commends her on all her efforts up to this point.

This event is going to set a historical precedent. Enterprise, and others like her born from Wisdom Cubes, are officially being recognized as people. Not as instruments of war or mere AIs created by man, but as people.

Now, of course, they haven't been legally granted universal human rights yet, but this is still a huge leap forward after all the setbacks we've faced. Truly, this is a day worth celebrating, Dr. Anzeel...

...And now, a news story from the Royal Islands. Since the start of the month, fishermen have reported finding what they described as "strange machines" in their hauls. The size of these machines has ranged from as long as nearly 3 meters, to as short as around 45 centimeters. They outwardly resemble deep-sea fish, with camouflage patterns imprinted on their scale-like exteriors. What's more, these exteriors seem to be made from a material that makes them almost impossible to detect by radar.

Many of the fishermen have claimed that, despite not weighing much and not having particularly thick scales, they are nevertheless extremely durable. One fisherman reportedly struck a machine with a harpoon and was shocked to find the impact hadn't left as much as a scratch on it. The Royal Society has taken charge of these machines for the time being and plans to conduct further analysis on them.

Some civilian scholars speculate that the machines are unmanned reconnaissance drones belonging to hostile forces, believing the larger machines to be central control systems for the smaller machines which do the reconnaissance. As for the reason why they were hauled up in Royal Islands waters, some have theorized they may have malfunctioned and simply drifted there, but nobody knows for certain.

Military experts have weighed in too, pointing out that the machines' distinct appearance is unlike any drone known to exist. They have further cited that the material the machines' exterior are made of, as well as the camouflage patterns painted on them, do not match those of any military drones in active service today...]]

...A large fleet of 400 warships from various factions has already gathered in the NA Area to prepare for tomorrow's navy-military joint exercises.
This is the third navy-military joint exercise to be held this year, and is the largest so far this year.
Unlike in the previous exercises, the new KAN-SEN weapons account for over half of the ships in the fleets present, and as a result, the general fleets, which have long been a major source of military might, have now been relegated to a supporting role to the dazzling KAN-SEN. According to the currently available information, the main purpose of this exercise is to familiarize the fleets with the KAN-SEN and to seek out new tactics.
The exercises are divided into solo exercises for KAN-SEN, joint exercises between general fleets and KAN-SEN, counter exercises between general fleets and KAN-SEN, counter exercises between KAN-SEN, and a final large-scale fleet review.
According to a spokesperson, this exercise is an annual naval review and has no political implications...]]

To Aoste,

...To be frank, the question as to whether or not artificial intelligence will eventually supersede humanity is not one I have an answer for.

From an evolutionary perspective, natural selection dictates that all organisms fight for survival, with the fittest species among them surviving. By these rules, countless species have risen and fallen, and there is no guarantee that humans will be the ultimate victors.

But before talking about "superseding," we must first ask if AI can fit into the definition of living organisms.

One definition of a living organism is a self-evolving system that can spontaneously undergo entropic changes for the purpose of promulgating itself. In a broader sense, the process of producing new individuals based on itself can be called "reproduction." Under this definition, the "vector" of life itself is not as important as its ability to undergo self-evolution in response to stochastic changes in entropy.

Ultimately, I agree with the view that any system, whether biological or artificially created, can be considered a living organism as long as it has a sense of self and is capable of thought. In other words, a true AI is in fact a living organism - and that's a hill I'm willing to die on.

But things get more complicated when you dig deeper. If the purpose of AI is to create a living organism that has a sense of self similar to humans but with greater cognitive capacity, will that lifeform be superior to humans? And will it "replace" us?

If true AI did exist, how do you think it would answer this question?

Looking forward to your response,

Anzeel,

...I don't deny that emotions are a requisite component of "true" AIs, but I would like to offer a few remarks regarding the topics of emotions, metacognition, and the definition of life that you have raised.

First and foremost, when considering the process of evoking emotions from memories, human beings can experience a gamut of emotions by retrieving memories stored in the brain. We know that AIs can replicate this process if they have the same cognitive protocols of storage and retrieval.

The problem is, memories stored in the human brain can deteriorate or change over time, and the technology to implant or manipulate those memories are still a pipe dream at this point. The inverse is true when it comes to artificial intelligence. Information stored in AI databanks does not degrade over time, and it is well within our technological capacity to input and manipulate that data. In other words, AI memories can be created synthetically.

Following this logic, emotions in AI can reliably be created by inputting a specific set of memories. Don't you think your idea of having them imitate human growth and development to accumulate "memories" is somewhat inefficient?

Best,

...Sorry about last time. I had no idea you were so invested in that topic.

Regarding my commentary about artificial intelligence at that time, I definitely could have been more careful with my choice of words. Even in a hypothetical environment, if we are to treat AI as living organisms, we must not ignore the fundamental rights to which they are entitled.

You are right - just like humans, an AI's memory is also valuable. If it were possible to perfectly manipulate human memories, that would spell the end of human civilization. However, if true AI is to exist in this world, there is another problem that we must first solve.

I'd like to discuss this topic with you further over dinner tonight, if you don't mind. How about Granate? It's not too far away, and their paella is absolutely divine.

Anzeel,

How are you holding up? I assume you're feeling fine, but I wanted to ask, just to be sure.
I heard the news about the terrorist who planted a bomb near the venue for the Cube Summit. Although I was worried at first, I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that the bomb was made using Cube technology.

I suspect that this attempted attack struck the security department's sensitive nerves. They've been hinting at the idea of raising security across the board on Samos Island so the scientists underground can work on their projects undisturbed.
While their reasoning is sound, the fact that they're working to set up special equipment around the research institute that detects Cube-based bombs is nothing short of comical. I have no idea what's gotten into them, and I can't be bothered to make some presentation about why Cube bombs aren't a realistic threat.

At the end of the day, raising the security level will impede communication between our various departments. At this rate, you'll probably need to fill out multiple forms if you ever feel like visiting us, even if just to sit down and have some tea. The easiest way to avoid all that hassle is, of course, for you to become part of my project team.

I'm sending you as much nonconfidential info as I can. Give my offer some thought, will you? You working with us would be like a dream come true.

Hope your mood improves,

Dr. Worrywart,

Let me start by letting you know I'm fine. In contrast to the wrinkly-faced professor, I couldn't care less about the attempted bombing. Well, almost; I wasn't completely unfazed. To paraphrase a proverb I learned while studying abroad, "annoyances are called that because they annoy." I'm hoping the organizers pick a better venue for their next summit.

At the same time, I can understand what the terrorist was thinking. From what I've learned, he's a so-called Cube worshipper, and his goal with the attack was to ruin the anti-Cube protestors' day. That's why he planted the bomb in a place where the protestors congregate, according to the police. If you ask me, both Cube worshippers and Cube protestors are just two sides of the same extremist coin.

On a different, but still disappointing, note: in protest of the new tariffs the Oceanic Federation imposed on Cube products as well as their "monopoly on scientific advancement," the Revolutionary Front has decided not to attend the Cube Summit. That means I won't get to meet Dr. Gloushkov, which sucks way more than the attempted bombing.
The only silver lining is that my plans to visit Iberia haven't come to naught.

Now, let's get down to brass tacks. I'm sorry, Aoste, but I can't join you. I read all the stuff you sent, and frankly, I feel like your project is in a completely different field to mine.
Be that as it may, I look forward to seeing the results of your research. You're a once-in-a-century genius, and I bet you'll bring the first stage of your design to fruition in another 2 or 3 years.
When that time comes, it won't be too late to invite me again.

Anzeel,

Happy New Year. How have you been? I know, I know, "great as always." You're surrounded by such brilliant people, after all.

Sorry in advance for skipping the small talk and going straight into science again. As you've probably guessed already, I want to talk about the Northern Parliament's new naval project they unveiled at the end of the year. The "Smart Operations Intelligence," or, as they call them, "the next-generation intelligent multi-purpose weapons platforms."

I believe this is Sonia Gloushkov's work. Seems she's been working hard on her research, even if she didn't attend the Cube Summit. I will say, I'd never guessed she had changed focus to the practical application of artificial intelligence over the past few years.
As much as I hoped these "next-generation" machines would live up to their name, they sadly don't look any more advanced than our autonomous armed patrol units. Their firepower is meager, and they can't even house a true artificial intelligence.
To be honest, I'm growing increasingly disappointed with her decision. As you know, more and more scientists are abandoning the field of theoretical research; nobody wants to work on doomed projects that can't incorporate Cube technology.

Finally, this brings me to the issue at hand. My Antiochus are facing a similar problem: there exists no platform capable of housing an artificial intelligence on the level of Zero, nor is there an environment where she can exercise her capabilities to their fullest. I believe the KAN-SEN's riggings have the potential to resolve this problem.
But of course, you're a bit more knowledgeable than me when it comes to Wisdom Cubes.

Anzeel, please tell me in no uncertain terms: is it possible to create an Antiochus from Wisdom Cubes?

Waiting to hear back from you,

Aoste,

I see your dilemma. Based on all the knowledge of my field of research, my answer (in no uncertain terms, as you asked) is this: it is impossible on every level.
A Wisdom Cube cannot materialize a concept that has no substance to it.

However, there is another way to fix your problems. In fact, it's been there all along, you've just refused to consider it.

Let's start from square one. The fundamental concept of ANTI-X is a low-cost, high-performance auxiliary fleet powered by artificial intelligence that fights alongside KAN-SEN. That is to say, the shipgirls are the main combat force, while the Antiochus provide support. They achieve victory not through brute force, but by leveraging their computing power to tactically outwit their opponents. What they need isn't bigger guns, but bigger brains – such as an artificial intelligence equivalent to li'l Zero.

Luckily, Wisdom Cubes can help you on that front. One thing I figured out through my research last year is that the space which Wisdom Cubes draw energy from also has the ability to store information. If you could use quantum computers on it, your Antiochus vessels should see a dramatic increase in computing power.

Having said that, the research on this subject is still in its infancy, so you might want to read through the Project Dusk archives. There's stuff in there that's bound to inspire you.

Finally, remember that there are no silver bullet solutions. Overambition always causes more harm than good.

Wish you success,

Anzeel,

Remember that thing we talked about at the start of last year? Well, I've got some wonderful news for you: the first Antiochus equipped with a true artificial intelligence – the next generation of the Antiochus– has been born!

Thanks to your idea, we've successfully developed a miniature quantum computer that can easily be installed even into our autonomous armed patrol units. Furthermore, as it uses a Cube as its core component, this mini-quantum computer can provide a stable energy source on its own, greatly alleviating the issue with our vessel's insufficient power supply.
As for the new AI herself, she was trained on Zero as a foundation. Strictly speaking, I suppose you could argue that makes her a Zero derivative.

However, a new issue has cropped up: since this Enforcer vessel carries the same AI foundation as Zero, I now need to give her a unique name. It's customary, you see.
On that note, do you have any ideas in mind? She does owe part of their existence to your research.

On the topic of Zero herself, through a few rounds of study and research, she has become quite the reliable assistant. In fact, her help will allow the whole institute to finish multiple complicated projects without recruiting a lot of new blood.
Maybe I should discuss the naming thing with her as well. She's bound to have some ideas.

The Antiochus Project just achieved a major breakthrough, the research team needs to expand, and moreover, Zero wants to meet you; indeed, there has never been a better time for you to join. Our institute has everything you'll need, and you can even continue your research right here.

What do you say? I have a seat and an office ready for you. They're yours if you want them.

Sincerely,

Aoste,

Should I start by congratulating you on your breakthrough, or by saying, "of course I'm on board"? I didn't expect that so many years after the end of Project Dusk, we'd get another chance to work together.

Though I do not know what your new Antiochus is like at this moment, the fact that you call them "next-generation" leads me to believe that they at least meet your baseline performance standards. You can be a bit of a perfectionist at times, but at least know that the military is quite pleased with your work.

I'm not sure if you've heard yet, but the military actually wanted me to transfer even before your invitation came. They seem to believe that my research into Type II can be the starting point for the next phase of ANTI-X. Of course, I didn't deny this – Type II's breakthrough in rigging technology will surely serve as inspiration for your future research as well. I believe you've named this new batch of Antiochus the Enforcer series? I sincerely believe you'll see it come to fruition sooner rather than later.

In any case, there's only so much I can say in one letter. I'll visit you in two months' time along with Laffey. When you see her, you'll understand then.

Best of luck in your research,

Dear Colonel Archer,

...As a researcher, I consider Enterprise as more than just an experimental subject to observe. She's also my child.

I can't even begin to express how proud of her I am, which is why I'm also worried about her future. I am just a mere scientist who knows little more than research and experimentation, but I can sense the power that girl has and the impact she will have on the entire world.

And if that power were to be used for war... If even I know about it, how can you, the military, not also know?

That is why I want to hear your thoughts about this whole thing. You're the most upstanding officer I know in the military, so... what does the Federation think of Enterprise? How much do they plan to intervene in this research? In other words, when do they plan to send her off to war?

...I know that day will come, sooner or later. I just hope that on that day, she will step onto the battlefield as a soldier and compatriot, rather than as some sort of weapon. Please, give these girls the rights and the glory they deserve.

...First of all, we fully understand your concerns, and I would like to personally meet with you to discuss these issues.

The bottom line is, the military is already aware of your research and will make their move soon. The timeline has been shifted up - the power demonstrated by Code G during that exercise was just as shocking to them as it was to me.

However, there is a silver lining to all this. The question of her status is still being discussed, and there is no immediate plan to use her on the battlefield. Very likely, the question of mass producibility is the military's top priority at this moment. If Wisdom Cubes can be constructed more efficiently, there will undoubtedly be a new military revolution that fundamentally overturns centuries of human warfare. They will redefine military doctrine for the next hundred years.

Rest assured, Doctor. We will do everything we can to improve the treatment of Code G so that she is seen as a warrior, rather than as a weapon.

Dear Colonel Archer,

Division 13, the special mooring and safekeeping facility established to bridge the gap between shipgirls and humans and develop mutual rapport, has finally paid off after so much hard work. After the commencement ceremony, Enterprise, as well as all other shipgirls, will finally be recognized as people just like us, not solely weapons of war.

Enterprise is not the type to wear her heart on her sleeves, and I've long been worried that she wouldn't be able to handle all the pressure that's been building up. But after seeing her confidence and the smile on her face today, my worries completely flew away.

Of course, our work is far from over. This achievement is only the first step of many, and the next step is to push for the revision of certain laws and policies as soon as possible. Until the rights of shipgirls are recognized in the same way human rights are, we cannot truly feel at ease.

But... I'm still worried about the current geopolitical situation. We've been locked in a tense stalemate for quite a long time now... Colonel, is war with the Revolutionary Front inevitable?

To Dr. Anzeel:

Your concern is understandable, but I believe cooler heads will prevail.

As you know, the Federation's military officers are rather hawkish, but nobody wants another full-blown World War to break out. Cube technology has been improving our lives day by day, and we can't just throw that all away. As far as I can tell, the other side has already shifted the brunt of their research toward environmental remodeling projects.

Having that said, I would expect this push-and-pull to continue for a period of time, given that none of us can envision reconciliation any time soon...

I do believe your heart is in the right place, Doctor, and I will do everything in my capacity to support your cause. I may not be able to change any laws, but I can introduce you to a number of my more politically-involved acquaintances. Given that election season is in full swing, once the savvier politicians get a glimpse of the potential of the shipgirls, they will be sure to support us.

On an unrelated note, have you heard about the "major earthquake" that occurred in the Bermudas? While I was digging for information on some classified servers, I encountered a "strange problem" that you might be able to shed some light on.

Last but not least, how is Enterprise doing these days? I haven't heard anything about her and the other girls from the Naval HQ recently, but I'd love to hear more about them the next time we get the chance.

Dear Colonel Archer,
I don't know how else to put this, but you have a dangerous situation on your hands.
There's not a lot of information for me to work with right now, but I can say one thing for sure: the energy that destroyed your unmanned submarines was not of natural origin. This energy might've been amplified by the seismic waves, but it also could've caused the earthquake to begin with.
The damage caused by this phenomenon is also extremely concerning to me. You may have already noticed this already, but the newer, E-Cube-powered submarines sustained more damage than submarines powered by traditional energy sources.
In any case, there is nothing I can do without first obtaining all of your research documents. If that's too much to ask for, then I at least need to know what experiments your team was performing with the Wisdom Cubes, or what modifications were made to the cubes during their work.
I won't have any definitive answers until I get to see the damages to the submarine cores in person, so I've submitted an application for an on-site investigation. Colonel, this is a warning: you must not allow the military to make any rash moves before I elucidate the nature of this energy.
Lastly, I would appreciate it if you could nudge the application process forward a bit faster.

To Dr. Anzeel:
I understand your concerns, but unfortunately, we don't have enough time left.
Our experiments in the Bermudas over the past few days have attracted the attention of the Revolutionary Front.
We have reliable intel that the Northern Parliament submarines that went missing just a few days prior have appeared in our vicinity. Additionally, the RF has mobilized its fleet stationed in the Antilles. I suspect that, in a matter of days to weeks, we will be surrounded by our "friendly" neighbors who plan to conduct exercises "with no particular target in mind."
Our problems also don't end there. Firstly, the army's opinions are divided on how to ensure your safety in light of the RF's activity. Secondly, the issue of how to move the large equipment you need for your investigation to the salvage site is also still being carefully evaluated. After all, our goals will be completely exposed once the RF sees the equipment.
In any case, I will try my best to get you permission for an on-site investigation, but best case scenario, it'll have to occur simultaneously with the salvage operation.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
Best,

Gather all our stuff, grab the kids, and run!
A large earthquake-like phenomenon was observed in the Bermudas! According to the Warning Notification System, a terrible tsunami is approaching, one that could endanger everyone along the East Coast!
The government is expected to issue an emergency evacuation order soon, so please collect all your valuables and wait in the driveway until then! I'm heading out right now, and will be back in about ten minutes!
Don't forget the emergency kit with our cash and cards!

Quarterly Report:
■ Quarter ■■ Situation Report ■■ City Police Department
The number of incidents this quarter increased by 476% from the previous quarter, with a significant increase after the Bermuda disaster. Among them, two types of incidents have had a sharp uptick in frequency.
1) Incidents caused by malfunction of electronic equipment throughout the jurisdiction. Power outages, explosions, fires, sudden shutdowns or malfunctions of various electronic devices such as medical equipment, including causes not limited to loss of power or unstable power supply. Due to a wide variety of equipment and models affected, we have eliminated the possibility of manufacturing defects in specific products as a cause for this uptick. The possibility of terrorism cannot be ruled out.

2) Violent crime. A particularly notable trend is a tendency to commit violent acts in a state of mental confusion. Additionally, according to some of the officers on-site, similar testimony has been provided by eyewitnesses confirming the presence of this phenomenon. In addition to a general deterioration in public safety following the disaster, it has been pointed out that a new hallucinogenic drug has started flowing into the city, and is likely related to the uptick in these incidents. Investigations into the composition of the drug are currently underway.

We would like to propose several measures to combat the deterioration of public safety following the disaster.
1) Mitigate the failure of electronic equipment by inspecting the city's infrastructure, repairing problematic areas, and replacing parts as necessary.
2) Request federal assistance in order to strengthen investigations into potential terrorist activities targeting electronic devices and infrastructure, as well investigations into the new hallucinogenic drugs.
3) Due to the tsunami's contamination of the urban water supply, that a public health emergency be declared, and to request research institutes in and around the district to cooperate with this investigation.
......

Currently, all personnel that otherwise would've been on vacation have returned to their posts to combat this urgent situation.

...I'm sure our readers are all familiar with what's been going on lately - yes, the unexplainable explosion of electronic devices and the sudden uptick in people going mad all throughout the East Coast after the Bermuda disaster!

As usual, the government tried to explain away these incidents, claiming that the disaster affected critical infrastructure and that the mass madness was caused by the influx of a new hallucinogenic drug. Sure, a tsunami might be able to destroy a subway station or a billboard, but how can it cause the tablet or computer inside your own home to explode? Also, allow me to point you to the incident where 20 people were arrested from Warehouse #5 last month, all of them were full-time employees of a business conglomerate, with one even being a middle manager! Why would so many people like that need to get together to do drugs?

If you're already familiar with all the facts up to this point, you've probably already reached your own conclusions. What we can say for certain is that none of this is an accident, and we will do the responsible thing in bringing you the truth - that all of these events, including the earthquake in the Bermudas itself, have been part of the government's plan!
Do not allow yourself to be fooled! All of this chaos has been an experiment from the government!

An anonymous source with knowledge of this experiment informed us that the Federation government has been conducting weapon tests on offshore platforms in the Bermudas, and those weapons were the cause of the massive earthquake.
Fortunately, this source has assured us that they will continue to update us with the latest and most important developments!

Stay tuned for more news about these mysterious weapon tests, as well as the latest shocking developments!]]

"They are nothing more than baseless conspiracy theories!"
At a press conference, an Eagle Union spokesman responded that the Northern Parliament's allegations were completely unfounded and irresponsible.
The spokesman added that monitoring data from this sea area showed radiation levels to be within normal limits following the tsunami's occurrence, and explained that the phenomenon was nothing more than a natural disaster rather than something man-made.

Several geologists made remarks in support of this statement, expressing their view that earthquakes of this sort with a shallow epicenter and extremely strong seismic intensity are rare but not unheard of. The International Marine Environment Protection Organization has also announced that it would closely monitor the impact of the earthquake on the surrounding marine environment...]]

A salvage company's contractual breach may be a major setback to the ocean economy
––View Full Article––

Recently, a major salvage company breached a contract in a way that has caught the attention of marine-based businesses around the world.

According to a notice posted on the official website of the Hercules Ocean Exploration Company, the lease agreement of certain salvage vessels under the company's name was temporarily terminated due to internal shifts in the company. Certain lawyers have pointed out that this unreasonable unilateral contractual termination will result in a massive penalty that, based on the company's financial data from its previous fiscal year, the Hercules Company will be unable to pay.

However, at the time of this article's publication, the Hercules Ocean Exploration Company's stock price has remained stable, and the company's board of directors has already released a public statement that the liquidation for the penalty was already completed at the end of the aforementioned lease agreement. It is unclear at this time how the company managed to raise this amount of money, but according to someone familiar with the company's internal operations, an "unnamed individual" provided crucial assistance in paying off this sum.

The company's fleet featured a new model of salvage ship powered by the E-Cube, and these ships quickly made a major impact on the global salvaging business. However, the company's withdrawal from this sector could be a prime opportunity for other businesses to step in. This need is even more evident, as governments around the world have been dedicating large amounts of time and resources into researching and raising sunken ships...]]

......
An undersea earthquake of unknown cause occurred in the Bermudas today, creating a tsunami that inflicted severe damage to our floating dock. Several research vessels were also lost in the tsunami's wake.
Fortunately, our communication lines were successfully reestablished after a brief downtime. Repairs to the dock are also underway.
Experts say this type of earthquake is "exceedingly rare" and the seismic waves were "unprecedented"... Those damn crackpot scientists. I've heard about their weird experiments on the platform, and now look what's happened!
Those research vessels have something to do with that earthquake, mark my words...
It's well into the night, and I still haven't gotten a dispatch order. People need rescuing out there, so what are we waiting for? Is the top brass going to let them die?]]

In conclusion, the earthquake was indeed not of natural origin.
While all equipment near the epicenter suffered severe damage, some measuring instruments in the floating dock did manage to survive the event. The data recovered from these instruments show that another earthquake, lower in intensity and with a shallower hypocenter, occurred 90 seconds before the "main" earthquake.
At present, the most probable scenario is that, prior to the earthquake, there was a tremendous burst of energy at the location believed to be the hypocenter. This immediately destroyed the research platform and subsequently caused the earthquake.
With our analysis of the recovered data and examination of the affected area, we have identified the cause of the energy burst. The first fluctuations originated from Platform No. ■, which conducts research into ■■■■■■■■ ■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■ ■■■■■■■■■■■ ■■■■■■■...]]

Despite the diver taking every possible safety precaution during this salvage operation, his health monitoring systems triggered an alarm within about ten minutes after entering the wreckage.
After his rescue, it was discovered that all his electronic equipment was broken, and the diver showed signs of extreme mental disturbance. The diver has since been transferred to the nearest research institute for treatment and observation.

…The convoy sent to refloat the platform broadcasted a distress signal before all contact was lost. Naval servicemen stationed on the floating dock near the disaster site were immediately dispatched to investigate and begin a rescue mission.

According to a sergeant who was among the first responders, only a handful of the several dozen vessels in the convoy were found, and all of those vessels were either on fire or had capsized.

Thanks to the heroic efforts of the rescue team, one sole survivor was found inside a freezer aboard a salvage vessel that sustained comparatively little damage. Unfortunately, this survivor displayed severe mental disturbance and was transported to the nearest research facility for medical observation and treatment. The individual remains in an uncommunicative state.

A follow-up investigation revealed numerous signs of fighting aboard the salvage ship, suggesting that a riot had broken out immediately before the incident. Findings indicate that a person had set fire to the galley, which then spread throughout the rest of the ship. It is possible that this riot is connected to the outbreaks of mass hysteria reported on the East Coast.

The records gathered from the ship suggest that, just prior to the incident, the crew had managed to recover an object of substantial importance from the sunken platform. As this object was not found aboard the ship during the investigation, it is likely that it sunk to the ocean floor once again...]]

...We've just arrived at the city located along the bay, the area most severely affected by the sandstorm. As you can see, the entire city has been buried in sand. For safety reasons, the local government has prohibited anyone other than professional relief agencies from entering the disaster area.

According to available information, the "Black Curtain," the largest sandstorm in recorded history, lasted for more than five hours, ravaging the entire region at speeds up to 90 miles per hour. Even the great sandstorms that struck the Eagle Union's Midwest over the last century pale in comparison to the Black Curtain's destructive power. The government is currently busy with emergency humanitarian operations, and has not released specific casualty numbers as of yet.

Leading Eagle Union meteorologists have stated that a once-in-a-century dry spell, compounded by severe desertification, increased the destructive power of this sandstorm, which will continue until it reaches the ocean.

Given the region's economic structure, already weakened by historic drops in oil prices, the occurrence of this sandstorm has the potential to become a "black swan" that impacts the global economy. Economists have warned that the financial risks posed by this disaster should be closely watched by the world's leading economies.

Four people are dead and over 200 injured in the wake of fatal clashes that broke out over the protest of Cube usage. Local police have arrested more than 100 protesters.

The city's factory workers' union has announced a general strike in support of the anti-Cube protest, to which city officials have expressed their disappointment, saying that "this decision only adds fuel to the flame." The clashes have plunged the city into a state of disarray, and chaos persists despite repeated calls from the mayor for involved parties to lower the temperature.

Moreover, the fallout from these protests is continuing to spread all over the world. At present, anti-Cube demonstrations have broken out in more than a dozen cities worldwide, and in the most severely affected areas, facilities of Cube-related industries have been targets of violent attacks.]]

...According to Eagle Union government officials, the Oceanic Federation's proposed improvements to Energy Cube-related legislation have already been approved, and will take effect across the country early next month.

This regulatory bill will impose new restrictions on all products related to Energy Cubes. According to information published on the official government website, these new regulations require all products using Energy Cubes to strictly limit their power output and service life, and require the operational licenses of all Energy Cube-related car manufacturers to be re-examined.

The bill's appendix includes a whitelist, but many common home appliances and convenience tools that have already become a part of daily life are not included. In other words, products such as Energy Cube flashlights, Energy Cube toys, and Energy Cube refrigerators will disappear from the market after a certain period of time.

When the proposed regulations were announced, shockwaves rippled across the entire economy, with the stock prices of tech giants and manufacturers plummeting in particular. Experts predict that after these regulations are implemented, the Wild West period of the Energy Cube industry's explosive growth will come to an end.

Experts also add that Cube-adjacent industries may experience a "hard winter" as a result of these regulations. It will be very difficult for companies looking either to enter the Energy Cube industry or to incorporate Energy Cubes into their products to obtain the necessary permits. In the same vein, these regulations also severely restrict the use of Energy Cubes in existing technology, so early entrants to the industry as well as already-licensed companies will face difficulties transforming their businesses in the near future.

As Professor Stanley Lu, an expert in Energy Cube Applied Sciences has pointed out, "the Golden Age may be over."]]

......On Monday, ■■/■■, ■■:■■ local time, a high-level meeting between the Consortium of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-CPEC countries has come to an end.

The two sides reached a consensus during the meeting that the production target set last October will be changed. This means that oil production will slowly increase by about ■■■,000 barrels a day until the end of the year.

Though this news has caused the internationally high oil and gas prices to drop somewhat, crude oil futures are still rising. Experts have pointed out that this indicates a widespread pessimism across global economies regarding the impact of this decision. It is not difficult to see that this slow increase in production will do little to alleviate the global energy crisis. Therefore, many people are speculating whether this meeting signals a shift in strategy to explore the possibility of continually ramping up production over time.

However, CPEC insiders have stated that "such increases are unlikely in the short term." The prolonged dominance of the Energy Cube industry in the energy sector has caused a long-term sluggishness in international crude oil prices. The unprecedented shrinking of related industries has crushed the economies of several important oil-producing countries, and the super-sandstorm that occurred in the first half of the year has severely damaged the oil production facilities of several major CPEC members. As a result, many experts believe that given the national debt situation of these countries, it is already difficult to return to previous production capacity, and further expanding production capacity is "short of impossible."

Taking all these factors into consideration, the CPEC has put forward a very conservative policy, and CPEC+ has signaled that they are satisfied for the time being given CPEC's current concessions.

However, this delicate balance may not last for long. As the energy crisis continues to deepen and energy prices continue to soar, CPEC+ may eventually decide to increase production across the board. But even if this situation eventually arises, even this increased production may not be able to meet such drastic energy demand...]]

However, judging from the responses, this lengthy article is full of logical fallacies and only serves to strengthen the opposite position.
We asked Miss Richard herself on what she thought about this article and related claims via her official social media account, and she responded only with this statement: "Many choose to believe that the Earth is flat. Does that make them any more correct?"
Within minutes of this post being uploaded, these words have become a top trending search across the internet..."]]

"...The city fair that was halted for many years will finally be held again!
For a long time, the stark contrast between the city's former glory and its condition in recent years has become a symbol of decay, with everything seemingly on the brink of collapse. However, after the arrival of the E-Cube industry, this place was granted a new lease on life. With the E-Cube at its heart, the city rapidly pulled itself out from its dire straits by embracing a brand new automotive industry, bringing clean-energy cars to the world while also reversing unemployment rates in a way economists could only describe as "miraculous."
To celebrate the city's revitalization, the city council decided to once again hold the city fair that had been suspended for many years. While the fair is guaranteed to have a wide range of offerings, the highlight of the event undoubtedly will be the E-Cube vehicle street racing event. The fair organizer previously stated that there would be a mysterious guest who wished to remain anonymous, but will also be participating in the race along with the city's residents."
"...When the event was held, the organizer's claims proved to be true. Many locals at the scene said that they saw a female racecar driver suspected to be 'Miss Richard,' and a local reporter even took a blurry photo. In the photo, the driver, believed to be Miss Richard, was driving a red sports car through the city's main street.
Surprisingly, the Navy's social media accounts denied the authenticity of the photo, insisting that Bon Homme Richard was not involved in the fair that day..."]]

Missile false alarm terrifies local residents
Today at 8:07 AM (HS-AI Time Zone), an emergency broadcast was issued to all residents of H.S. State, with the following message: "A nuclear missile is approaching H.S. State. A nuclear missile is approaching H.S. State. Please enter your nearest bunker immediately. This is not a drill."
This was quickly identified as a false alarm, and three minutes later, the Oceanic Federation Command notified the National Guard that there was no incoming missile.

At 8:18 AM, 11 minutes later, the state government corrected the notification and issued another emergency broadcast stating that the previous broadcast was a false alarm. The H.S. Emergency Preparedness Service said that the alert was sent out due to staff error, but this incident had already caused a number of problems, adding to the state's already turbulent year.

Users on the internet were quick to make fun of this incident, but for the locals, the false alarm was nothing short of terrifying and mind-boggling. Almost immediately, people began drawing parallels between the series of inexplicable accidents and the mysterious incident at the training site in the Bermudas.

Can the gag orders issued by the Oceanic Federation and the Revolutionary Front really prevent the widespread societal unrest from deteriorating further?

Host: Now with the world's attention focused on the tension between the Oceanic Federation and the Revolutionary Front, how likely do you think it is that we'll get another global war in the near future?

Expert: This is war we're talking about, and I think a lot of these concerns are overblown. If either side truly wanted to start a war, the day of the accident would've been the best time to do it. But despite that, both sides have actually demonstrated more restraint since the accident, increasing the distance between their fleets with no signs of saber-rattling present.

Host: Who do you think has the upper hand right now?

Expert: Given the strength of the forces on both sides, it's truly difficult to say which is superior... One popular view is that because the strength of the training fleets stationed in the Bermudas is evenly matched, this balance of power has largely suppressed the possibility of an actual confrontation.

Host: There have been rumors circulating around that the Federation's fleet has suffered serious damage due to the accident.

Expert: You hear plenty of conspiracy theories out there, but rumors are just that - rumors. Hypothetically speaking, if the Federation's fleet had suffered so much damage, there would be no reason for the Revolutionary Front to hide that information.

Host: Thank you. Next, I'd like to talk about the missile false alarm incident in H.S. the other day...

Guys, this whole thing is one huge conspiracy. I got some info from a friend - he says there's been a lot of activity at the pier lately. Guess what? They're moving warship wrecks around. The standoff with RF never ended. If anything, it's escalated into a full-blown war. BHR could possibly already be dead, but I'm gonna keep digging. I don't buy that BS about her "disappearing."

Dunno if it's related but apparently they took some Colonel Archer's family hostage.
Also, someone's after me, so I'm gonna lay low for a bit.
Kraken, this is important, so listen. They've got their eyes on you too. Do NOT go to the port tomorrow.

...Our dear viewers, we have news from our on-site reporter. At 14 minutes past midnight, the meeting with the Revolutionary Front regarding the chain of incidents in the Bermudas came to a close.

A representative of the Northern Parliament's armed forces stated that the Revolutionary Front's meeting with the Oceanic Federation was "constructive and friendly." After both sides had provided their accounts, they said that the rising tension in the Bermudas was all caused by "a series of misunderstandings."

Our reporter was told that the confrontation there ended peacefully, and that the rumors about both sides preparing for war were completely false.

A high-ranking Oceanic Federation official confirmed this statement and went on to praise the Northern Parliament for its measured, peace-promoting stance on the matter. This official also said that both parties are fully committed to maintaining world peace, and that a hotline between the two sides has been established to help prevent similar confrontations in the future.

Both the Revolutionary Front and the Oceanic Federation have signed a memorandum concerning this matter. More details will follow later this afternoon...]]

Resolution Establishing the Richard Incident Investigation Committee

...Per the Department of Defense's request, a special investigation committee is to be established in service of researching the chain of accidents caused by Division 13 KAN-SEN Bon Homme Richard during Oceanic Federation military exercises on ■■/■■/■■■■. Furthermore, by their suggestion, this will henceforth be referred to as the Richard Affair.

The committee will consist of a total of 144 members in relevant fields, including personnel from the Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Executive Office, as well as select representatives from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, Federal Council and Secretariats, Military Affairs Committee, and National Academy of Sciences.

The investigation committee will be headquartered on Samos Island. The first meeting is to be held before ■■/■■ this year, though the exact date is to be decided based on the progress of the preliminary investigation.

Until the aforementioned meeting, executive authority of the committee will be held by three representatives, one from each of the Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Executive Office.

After the passage of this resolution, leadership of the committee will, on behalf of the committee:
1. Have full authority and responsibility over the investigation of this affair.
2. Designate Samos Island and the surrounding region as a control zone and evacuate all except members of the committee.
3. On a weekly basis...

-- Actually, exploded isn't the right word. When we turned around, their flagship was just gone. In its place was a black tornado, out of nowhere.
- Did this black tornado attack our fleet?
-- I can't say for certain, but... That thing did start moving toward the nearest warship. Almost like it had a mind of its own. And then, we got a message from the second fleet's flagship. They said, "Stamp out rebellion."
-- From there, the black tornado grew into a large-scale hurricane that enveloped the RF's fleet along with us. That was when utter chaos broke out. Everyone started firing on each other until they sank. It was so horrifying that I thought it was the onset of a new world war...
- Was the sixth fleet you were in affected by the black tornado?
-- There was enough distance between us and the black tornado to let us get away, but shortly after the tornado appeared, all our gauges and electronics malfunctioned. Then, our communication equipment went down, followed by the power system, and then—[bleep]—]]

-- You know damn well who I am. You people transferred us here in the first place.
- My apologies, sir, but consider it a formality. We were given orders to bring your family here for protection purposes. You may know this already, but I'm a friend of John's. I volunteered for this mission myself.

-- Of course not! I haven't seen him in so long. If there's anything unusual, it's that you refuse to tell me anything about him.
-- What in the world happened to my John?
- We're trying to figure that out too, ma'am. That's why we need your cooperation.
-- I know you won't tell me, but he was part of some secret plan, wasn't he? Something must have happened to him, right?!

- So, you received a message from the Enterprise, then cooperated with the Revolutionary Front in a joint operation. Is that correct?
-- That is correct.
- Do you understand that not only was this operation unauthorized, but also that Captain Archer of the Enterprise did not have the authority to bypass the flagship and give you orders directly?
-- Do you have any idea what kind of situation we were in, Mr. Investigator?
-- The second fleet was burning up and there was a massive storm raging. Our comms were completely busted. You can't maintain radio contact with the flagship when every man is fighting just to stay alive. Do you understand what I'm saying? The chain of command had completely and utterly disintegrated.
-- What Captain Archer did was take over command to reorganize the fleet and mount a counterattack. Did I obey his orders, you ask? Yes. And I would do it again.
-- I would follow any order if it would get us out of that hellscape alive.
- Did Captain Archer contact the Revolutionary Front first? Did he tell them he wished to cooperate?
-- No. They contacted him. I think they wanted revenge for their fallen comrades, just as we did.
- You said he intended to "mount a counterattack." Against what, exactly? The tornado, a force of nature? If so, are you implying he already knew what had caused the incident?

Regarding the basic layout of the "Richard Incident", as well as subsequent decisions
–––
......
At this point, we have largely finished our investigation into the sequence of events surrounding the Richard Incident. What we can now confirm is that the 'Bon Homme Richard' launched an offensive on all present warships after coming in contact with an important cargo, codenamed 'Pandora's Box'. Multiple eyewitness testimonies at the time compared this offensive to a "natural disaster" of some sort.
After the chain of command collapsed, Cpt. John Archer led the survivors in a counterattack alongside the Revolutionary Front fleet, successfully neutralizing the 'Bon Homme Richard' after several hours of fierce fighting. Marines stationed aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Enterprise, likely retrieved 'Pandora's Box' during that time, and approximately forty minutes after the operation ended, Cpt. Archer and carrier Enterprise disengaged from the fleet and attempted to plunge into the depths of the ocean.
......
Crucially, the cause of the erratic behavior exhibited by the 'Bon Homme Richard' as well as by Cpt. John Archer remains unknown. In order to determine the truth in a thorough manner, the Investigation Committee recommends the following actions:
1. Launch a formal investigation into Cpt. John Archer.
2. Send additional salvage teams to recover as much related wreckage as possible to determine the whereabouts of 'Pandora's Box' as quickly as possible.
3. Set up a new technical analysis team and allow some members of the 'Dusk' team who have passed background checks to join the team.
4. Add communication channels to ensure that the reporting of key evidence continues to be smooth and efficient.

Post-investigation decisions made in regards to the "Richard Incident"
–––
......
Early yesterday morning, the salvage team completed their final recovery stages. Eagle Union leadership has confirmed that no more salvage operations will take place unless more significant discoveries take place, and has handed over all recovered key evidence to the analysis team.

Per the DHS's request, postmortem investigations will now focus on information security. In response to several recent incidents of leaked materials, the Investigation Committee recommends the following:
- More stringent background checks on staff to eliminate factors of instability
- Reassign staff members' access authority level and complete the encryption key update by the end of the month
- Transfer all analytical work to Samos
- Establish a new information channel for the public to maintain stability within public opinion

Additionally, now that the investigation has entered a new phase, all documents related to the "Richard Incident" will now be centrally managed under the name of "Richard Files." All documents that are a part of the "Richard Archives" are to be kept on paper only.

After analyzing the wreckage of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Enterprise, experts have discovered a form of "energy radiation" distinct from ionizing radiation under high-energy conditions. According to reports from onsite personnel, this "energy radiation" appears to destroy certain types of precision measuring equipment. Radiation levels are also consistent with figures reported in the recent "salvage crew incident," according to the Investigation Committee. To prevent further damage, surveying operations were suspended, and malfunctioning instruments quarantined.

A small amount of survey data obtained from the wreckage has already been sent to a laboratory in Samos for analysis. According to the PI in charge there, this new type of energy is emitted externally in a form similar to electromagnetic radiation. This speculation would be substantiated if the "source" of the emission were to be located.

However, the wreckage of the Enterprise is still in a state that is deemed "harmful to living organisms," and further investigation into the energy radiation phenomenon is unlikely to continue any time soon.

According to logged data, this carrier-based aircraft took off from the nuclear aircraft carrier Enterprise to engage the Bon Homme Richard. After it was hit, it made an emergency landing, and is the only surviving aircraft from the 6th Fleet.

An analysis of the damage to the aircraft's E-Cube engine revealed that in addition to mechanical damage caused by the uptake of smoke and debris, the physical structure of the engine had undergone an unbelievable change. Furthermore, investigators determined that a black pattern of unknown origin had appeared on the outer shell of the E-Cube that supplied power to the engine.

This transformational phenomenon is being referred to as "metamorphosis" for the time being. According to investigators, the E-Cube engines of other weapons used during the battle also exhibited varying degrees of "metamorphosis" regardless of whether they had been damaged or not. This suggests that the phenomenon is not caused by external physical damage, but rather by some unknown radiation.

Another phenomenon was also observed in addition to "metamorphosis." Timekeeping devices retrieved from the aircraft suggest that there was a noticeable "time dilation" effect around the area of engagement. This may be related to the space-time anomaly that has formed in the waters near Samos, though more evidence is needed to substantiate this claim.

-Excuse me.
--Oh? ...Pardon, I didn't mean any offense. I just didn't expect to find any sane survivors.
-Understandable. It must be the influence of Pandora's Box.
--"Pandora's Box?"
-The cargo we salvaged from the water after defeating the Bon Homme Richard.
-But within minutes of the salvage operation, something terrible happened. Everyone felt this suffocating aura, as if something was enveloping us. Then, there was pain, as if our brains were on fire...
-The Marines that salvaged the Box went completely insane. We're not faring much better.
-The only thing I remember was Captain Archer yelling, "trust in reality." And then somehow, I survived.
-When I regained consciousness, the cabin was a complete mess.
-Captain Archer blocked off the passage to the cabin housing the cargo, and told us to stay away from it at all costs.
--So Captain Archer believed that this "Pandora's Box" was the reason why all of this happened? Did you see it with your own eyes?
-No, but I do remember... the Marines that came in contact with it started turning into...
-BLURGH...
--Relax, relax. Let's not think about that then. What happened after that?
-Urgh... Captain Archer said... that the Box had to be destroyed, and that it mustn't be brought back to civilization.
-So, we chose to sail east, deeper into the Atlantic.
-But before we made it, Captain Archer gave the order for everyone to abandon ship. Most of us got onto lifeboats, and only he and a few others stayed behind.
--So, he gave the order to evacuate but didn't leave the ship himself?
-That's right. I didn't see him after that, or on the ship that came to pick up the survivors.
--Thank you for your cooperation, soldier. You've been a great help to our investigation. We have a few minutes left, so do you have any questions for me?
-I saw that explosion. Please tell me... Captain Archer, is he still alive...?
-...I see. Can I ask you for just one favor?

As of now, the actions of the Enterprise and of John Archer have been thoroughly investigated. The following facts are certain: Captain John Archer upheld his duties until his final breath, saving the lives of some 3,300 people aboard the ship as well as the rest of the Eagle Union fleet, at the cost of his own. For the above reason, the Joint Chief of Staff, Department of Defense, and Oval Office have all agreed that there is no evidence to consider these actions a voluntary defection, and instead, that John Archer be honored for his courage and will.

In light of Captain Archer's achievements in quelling the rebellion of the Bon Homme Richard and the importance of maintaining the dignity of the Oceanic Federation, the Investigation Committee makes the following recommendations for the handling of Captain John Archer's case:

1) Let it be determined that Captain John Archer handled the crisis with great courage and utmost professionalism, tragically meeting his end along with his ship.
2) Let it be determined that Captain John Archer demonstrated great courage during the incident, sacrificing himself to save as many lives as possible.
3) Posthumously award Captain John Archer with the Medal of Honor and Naval Cross, and give him a proper burial in the National Cemetery.

In light of the damage caused by the cargo known as "Pandora's Box," the Investigation Committee makes the following recommendations:

1) Establish a Work Safety Team on top of existing foundations, with the purpose of evaluating the safety of all such related items.
2) To strengthen safety precautions, all work related to the wreckage must be done under the authorization of the Investigation Committee and supervision of the Work Safety Team.
