One example is the mysterious ■■■■■■ Explosion that occurred in Northern Parliament territory. \nOn ■■/■■/■■■■ at daybreak, there was a huge explosion comparable to a nuclear detonation in the western part of the Northern Parliament, completely destroying a forested region of greater than 20■■ square kilometers. The cause of this mysterious explosion has attracted the attention of countless scientists and scholars for a century. Though many hypotheses have been proposed, no consensus has been reached by the academic community, and this case remains an unresolved historical mystery. \nJust when the world had begun to slowly forget about it, scientists made shocking progress in recent days by relying on the cutting-edge technology to re-explore the ancient ■■■■■■ area.

…After an investigation, it was concluded that the massive explosion that occurred in Northern Parliament territory was most likely caused by a meteorite impact. This is generally consistent with the long-held Aerolith Hypothesis, but the actual situation is quite a bit different from what the hypothesis posited. 
The most suspicious aspect of the ■■■■■■ Explosion: 
At least three powerful explosions occurred simultaneously, and three craters were identified. However, no meteorite fragments were found at the scene. 
Though the Aerolith Hypothesis can explain the incident to some extent, this piece of evidence is what prevented this theory from being broadly accepted. However, the latest research finally proposed a reasonable explanation to what happened to the meteorite fragments. 
Research showed that meteorites that hit the earth first broke up into several pieces due to mesospheric friction, thus forming three separate explosion craters. Additionally, according to calculations, the three impact sites in the ■■■■■■ region may only represent the impact points of some of these fragments; other meteorites whose orbits were changed during atmospheric entry have a high probability of having fallen into the polar regions. Due to the special qualities of these meteorite fragments, they may have quickly “melted” into the surrounding environment. Therefore, the actual fragments have not been found at the impact sites, resulting in the mystery that still persists today...]],

However, following this paper, countless reporters, researchers, explorers, and tourists from all over the league flocked to the forest where the meteorite impacts remain. 
According to customs officials, over the last three months, the number of scientific research entry applications increased more than a hundred times compared to the same period in previous years, with all other types of applications also increasing significantly.

Differences in specifications during the production process of this container will directly affect the quality of the resulting ε-Cube. At the Summit, scientists carried out extensive discussions of the experimental data published by various countries, finally formulating a series of standards to produce a stable and reliable ε-Cube.

...Waste disposal and recycling have been one of humanity's hardest-to-solve problems for years. As the chemical compounds that form a cornerstone of our modern society grow increasingly complex, the primitive method of disposing of them in landfills starts to become infeasible, while microbes capable of decomposing waste products are unable to satisfy even a tiny fraction of global demand. Recycling, meanwhile, is crippled by its elaborate and costly sorting processes, and thus the percentage of waste being recycled globally has remained low.

At present, the most popular waste disposal method is concentrated incineration in special-made compartments. This allows for the maximum amount of energy possible to be extracted from the waste. Afterwards, the residue goes through several steps of processing, including one step wherein metal components are retrieved and collected.
Regardless, due to the sheer number of Cube energy farms that have been constructed, waste-burning energy production has become a high-cost, low-profit industry. As a result, we face a dilemma where more and more waste treatment facilities are forced to close down, even though we need them.

There is a silver lining, however. Cubes created this conundrum, but they can also solve it. As Cubes are a practically free energy source,

...Cubes, being a compact energy source, were seemingly the perfect solution to the power supply question faced by many engineers working on Powered Combat Suit (PCS) projects around the world. Tests have showed the Cubes not only extend a PCS's maximum operational time, they also provide it with enhanced mobility and an astounding increase in speed.
Due to the limitations of last-generation energy supply solutions, old PCS models were semi-open designs created to be as lightweight as possible. As these models were unable to provide their user with full-body protection, they only saw extremely limited usage.
After the breakthroughs of Cube technology, this fundamental problem became all but a non-issue. PCS design has undergone a complete reversal with the latest generation, with most models favoring a casing that fully encloses the operator. These suits put emphasis on increased firepower and armor, life-support for missions in hazardous environments, and systems that raise the operator's tactical awareness. The PCS, once merely an auxiliary combat aide, has transformed into a literal war machine.
This rapid development has sparked debate among engineers over the PCS's fundamental design, however. Some argue the bipedal model designed around the human body is here to stay, while others propose switching to wheeled vehicle-type designs featuring superior stability. Others still ponder the feasibility of leveraging the Cubes' almost inexhaustible energy to create suits with "wings"...]],

...The FNH Group's new model of heavy machine gun, the FNCB4, has passed inspection and is scheduled for adoption by the military soon. The FNCB4 has an integrated miniature Cube which continuously provides the weapon's other components with energy. This grand departure from long-standing HMG design tradition allowed for many innovations that take advantage of the Cube technology's abundant energy, such as kinetic energy accelerators embedded in the barrel, and a ballistic trajectory correction device built into in the weapon's sights, among others.

The HMG can be further categorized into one of 8 models based on intended use, most notably:
- FNCB4A, for use by infantry
- FNCB4B, for use in Powered Combat Suits
- FNCB4F, for use by large drones
- FNCB4H, for use on unmanned warships

7 out of 8 models cleared all tests; testing of model FNCB4B has been postponed due to a malfunction with the testing platform. The remaining 7 models are all slated to enter mass-production.
The FNH Group's most high-profile weapons project, a high-energy laser weapon powered by Cube technologies, did not make an appearance at this round of testing. When asked about this, the public relations manager at FNH Group informed us the weapon is still in the testing phase...]],

...The Northern Parliament will once again be sending their tried and tested nuclear-powered space shuttle on a resupply mission to Space Station Emir.

Once they have been successfully installed, these units will then provide the station's existing installations with additional output.

The Northern Parliament intends to install additional Cube power units on the station in the future and further expand the Emir's operational scope.
Additionally, a Northern Parliament space program representative announced that plans are in the works to construct a new docking platform that would allow the station to store and launch probes into deep-space. These probes are currently under development and will be powered with Cube technology.

Upon review of both nuclear-powered and Cube-powered space shuttles for use in low-Earth orbit, scientists found that Cube-powered shuttles do not have any significant advantages over their older nuclear-powered counterparts.

More like they're rolling out a testbed of a converted light tank. The specs are all classified, so it's anyone's guess how it actually performs in combat. It's pretty much the same size based on the pics they've released to the public so far too, so my educated guess is the only major change is the new compact cube engine is gonna open up space and improve crew comfort.

...This article provides information about the "ECHO Plan" recently unveiled by the X.O.S. Chamber of Commerce. Based on the published materials, the "ECHO Plan" is divided into three stages, but so far only the first two have been disclosed publicly.
In the first stage, the Chamber of Commerce will mobilize R&D resources and talent to achieve breakthroughs in Cube technology and applications in the aviation sector. Currently, Cube-powered engines can only be used in large stationary machines and small to medium-sized ground vehicles. If this development goes smoothly, engines for large drones will be developed first, followed by engines for passenger planes and freight, then finally, engines for combat aircraft. Imagine the joys of flying without a need to refuel.
The completion of the first stage of the plan will revolutionize the traditional aviation industry, leaving tanker aircraft behind in history. In the second phase, following on the success of Cube-powered aircraft engines, the Chamber of Commerce plans to develop Cube-powered rockets for near-Earth orbital transport and deep space exploration.

The end result is not as efficient or as clean as a pure E-Cube engine, and it is also harder to maintain. However, the installation process is far simpler and less time-consuming. This greatly reduces the structural hurdles such as having the necessary equipment and technical personnel, and is more compatible with dated fleets. It is possible to modernize an entire fleet in a short period of time."

A Royal Navy representative concluded the summit with the following statement:

"The arrival of Energy Cubes changed the face of our world forever. With their vast range of applications, we managed to solve all our food and energy problems at the fundamental level.

But, as many people have suspected, not all things these Cubes brought into existence have been good. As a matter of fact, we are on the verge of a crisis of an unprecedented scale. Our enemies have weaponised the Energy Cubes. They have set up countless test facilities to conduct research on the Cubes, and they are trying to use the Cubes' vast range of applications as a weapon to destroy us!

Countless hours of research have been sunk into production methods and ways to increase energy efficiency. It is the fundamental workings of the Cubes which anyone has yet to try to explain.

Megacorporations have set up who knows how many research labs dedicated to these blue miracle-makers, but the scope of their research is limited solely to Cubes as an energy source. Their only objective is to create a Cube that's more energy-efficient than the last.

My research, meanwhile, has found evidence that Cubes are so much more than just souped-up batteries. Their use as an energy source is only the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, the many mysteries they hold will take time and effort to unravel.

...Breaking news! The former admiral of the Enterprise, who confronted the Northern Parliament's fleet, has gone missing!
The incident began a few days ago. Aircraft carrier Enterprise is slated to undergo extensive maintenance for 36 months at the SD Naval Base, but immediately upon its arrival, the admiral was to leave the base to participate in meetings with the naval leadership.
Initially, our journalists were planning to ask the admiral about the impact of Cube-powered warships on global affairs and what this maintenance would bring to the Enterprise during a normal press conference. However, even though the press conference was in full swing, the admiral was absent without prior notice despite being scheduled to attend! While the press conference itself concluded without further issue, we followed some suspicious leads and conducted our own investigation for a few days. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that the admiral had gone missing!
After entering the Department of Defense building, the admiral seemed to have "disappeared" from the building without a trace, and there were no traces of him leaving.

…As of the time of this report, Phase I of testing has already been completed.

During Phase I of the project, our team focused on optimizing the power supply and expanding the functionality of the ε-Cube. So far, military-grade ε-Cubes have seen a 312% increase in power output, 76% increase in stability, and a 20% reduction in volume compared to the previous specification. 

Though these specifications are quite different from the international standard, we nevertheless consider this model to be the most suitable for military usage among the variations currently being researched. We also have made significant breakthroughs in its application to military armaments, the details which have been omitted here but can be found in the addendum to this report. These application studies have been handed to the working group, which will continue subsequent research into that subject. Our team instead has transitioned into Phase II: identifying how ε-Cubes are capable of generating energy.

To our knowledge, many parties are already carrying out similar lines of research, though no breakthroughs have been made on this front. While it is possible that their research has yielded no fruit, we cannot rule out the possibility that information is being withheld to stymie the efforts of other researchers.

Regardless, we plan to do away with any speculation and return to studying the building blocks of the ε-Cube at a sub-atomic level. However, our current facilities do not meet the conditions that would allow us to advance our research in the way outlined above. Therefore, we would like to apply for two things: First, that a new lab be established in the Somers Isle in the Bermuda Triangle capable of satisfying our equipment, environmental, and confidentiality needs, and second, that permission to view the confidential research materials of "Project Dusk" be granted.

...Our team went back to the point of origin to try to reproduce the environment in which the ε-Cube was first born, unlike modern manufacturing settings in which Cubes can be produced stably. Under these environments, though the strength and stability of power output fluctuated dramatically, I was able to observe a point that could be considered the "birth" of an ε-Cube many times. As long as there are no requirements on the power output, the number of possible configurations for ε-Cubes do not merely number in the dozens. Though there is likely plenty of room for improvement, I do believe that from a military standpoint, the ε-Cubes currently in use are already closest to the optimal configuration.

It is worth noting that throughout the experiment, the ε-Cubes did not generate power in a continuous manner. Energy production would change from a 0 to a 1 only after certain conditions were met, similar to flipping a light switch.

In a sense, this phenomenon is similar to the relationship between potential and kinetic energy. However, the ε-Cube does not explicitly act upon any matter in the process of generating power, nor does it lose mass. None of the physical principles we currently have adequately explained the functionality of the ε-Cube.

To continue the next phase of research, I would like permission to view all of the research data from the now-frozen "Polar Analysis" project.

...Experiments to extract energy from the ε-Cube are still ongoing. As we expected, the energy "contained" within an ε-Cube is literally inexhaustible, whether through civilian or military use, and the service life of an ε-Cube is determined not by the amount of energy it contains, but rather by the properties of the materials that go into the Cube. We came to the conclusion that the most important determinant is the durability of the materials. In essence, this is the exact opposite of nuclear fission.

From our experimental results, should there be some material that can withstand long-term usage, ε-Cubes should be able to provide energy continuously without any external input, akin to a perpetual motion machine. Additionally, the quality of the ε-Cube affects its power output, something that is already widely known.

Further evidence exists to support my hypothesis: that the ε-Cube is a device that extracts energy, rather than produces it. Beyond the mechanics of the Cube itself, I do not particularly care what the true origins or nature of this energy are. While I could make some educated guesses, that would fly in the face of scientific principles and common sense itself. All that matters is that we continue our research. For that purpose, it would be very helpful if ALL the data from the "Polar Analysis" project be made available...

...The results of the experiment are unbelievable. If we eliminate every impossible hypothesis one by one, we must accept the last one remaining, no matter how unbelievable it may seem. With the belief that it is in fact true, my team has worked ceaselessly to test all hypotheses until finally, we have arrived at the truth. I can say with certainty that the energy source of the ε-Cube must exist in a higher dimensional space, separate from the space-time we exist in.

All our experiments have pointed to the same conclusion over and over. The energy from an ε-Cube comes from a higher dimensional space that has always been theorized to exist, but could never be proven because there was no way to observe it. The ε-Cube acts like a transducer, continuously converting the energy stored in the higher dimension and outputting it in a usable form in our dimension, therefore acting like a perpetual motion machine that defies the laws of physics.

Even though we produced and utilized the ε-Cube, we had no idea how it worked... until now. Though this is a revolutionary breakthrough, I can't help but think about how that higher-dimension space came to exist. If the theory that higher-dimension space can house an infinite number of lower-dimension spaces, and lower-dimension space can be observed, then by applying these theories... ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■...

...After thoroughly analyzing all the data left in the Polar Decompilation project, our team has made remarkable progress in studying the material compositions of ε-Cubes.

At first, it was believed that only a sturdy and stable material could be made into a durable ε-Cube – that is, the ε-Cube would inherit the properties of the material itself.

Naturally, that belief is common sense in our world. For example, a bowl made of wood has the same properties as wood. A bowl made of paper would also have the same properties as paper. As such, anyone could tell you that a bowl of wood is sturdier than a bowl of paper. However, this common sense does not apply to ε-Cubes, and until now, all the research on materials has been nothing more than trial and error based upon a faulty notion of common sense.

The ε-Cube does not inherit the properties of the materials used to make it, but rather changes based upon those materials. Simply put, an ε-Cube is more than the sum of the components used to make it. Whether wood or paper, the properties of the Cube are not completely related to the physical properties of the components. Of course, neither wood nor paper are suitable materials for the construction of an ε-Cube shell, but with this knowledge, we once again open ourselves to countless new possibilities worth trying, such as ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■...

...With this, Phase II of our research has been completed. The derivative cube, tentatively named "Chokhmah," has proven many of the hypotheses outlined in previous reports.

So far, our research has already accomplished what it initially sought out to do: determine the ε-Cube's true energy source. However, because our results were so unexpected, the mysteries behind the ε-Cube have only grown deeper. So plagued am I by doubts about the existence of this higher dimension of energy that I cannot even feel joy at the truth that was just uncovered.

In light of these findings, it is necessary to review the research results obtained from Phase I of the project. I've decided to leave this to another team.

As for Phase III... That is, the study of this higher-dimensional space, my team will analyze this unknown space, deepen our understanding of it, re-examine the very framework of the reality we live in, and perhaps, even prove ■■■■■■...

I would like to apply for a tour of Project Dusk's testing grounds. Our research will surely prove useful for Project Dusk, and I am curious about the implications that Code G's existence has for our future research...

...The experiment finally worked! After so many twists and turns, I was starting to doubt if we were even on the right track... but I'm so glad we stuck it through to the very end! I initially posited that ε-Cube was much more than just an energy source that would advance technology in human society, and the research results proved that I was correct.

(Dr. Aoste's research was very helpful. I'll have to bring him a thank-you present...)

Umm... "By improving the materials, we succeeded in creating a variant of the ε-Cube... We didn't have a name for it, but after doing some research and getting feedback from the other team members..." Yeah, let's go with "Wisdom Cube." I like the sound of that!

Let's see... Next is... "In a special environment adjusted from the previous iteration of experiments, by applying a controlled amount of stimulation to the ε-Cube, we were able to induce a resonance reaction with the materials in the same environment and maintain stability without interference by the Cube's complex fluctuations. From this, we witnessed an entirely new intelligent entity born from the ε-Cube."

Hmm... I'm not sure "born" is the right word to use here. The materials around the ε-Cube all disappeared, so in other words... "Rather than being created from nothing, the particles of the matter were rearranged and reassembled due to reaching a certain resonance between the ε-Cube and the various materials." ...From an outside perspective, all of this may appear to be encroaching on the realm of God, but as a researcher, and as a director of this project, it's my job to explain this phenomenon in scientific terms...

...As for the naming issue, from a management standpoint, all experimental products require some kind of code number for identification purposes, but this is truly a unique case... At the agency's urging, I finally decided on the name "Code G" and announced it at today's meeting.

So from now on, her name is Code G, Singularity G, or just "G" if you prefer something shorter. As for me, I like the idea of giving her a name just like a real human, so I call her "Enterprise." After all, the idea of calling a person by a code is just... Well, I hope I can get the other staff members to see her as human as well.

So from now on, I'll write down some information about Enterprise every day.

Born with the body of a human female, the intelligent body "Enterprise" has an almost perfect grasp of our world's knowledge and language, as if it had come pre-installed in her head (because of this, everyone in the facility sees her as an overly diligent AI). On the other hand, her ability to live life like a normal human being seems rather lacking, and her mental age appears to also be... around that of a human middle schooler? Considering the rarity of Wisdom Cubes, we'll most likely be limited to simply observing her for the time being...

...As our observation continued, Enterprise's humanity became more and more evident.

So, first of all, her physiological characteristics are almost identical to that of a human: she eats the same food, breathes and sleeps like a human, and even shares most of the same vital signs. The primary difference is that unlike humans, her appearance and stature appears to be fixed. She doesn't gain weight no matter how much she eats, and her hair quickly returns to its original length no matter how much of it you cut off. I'm not sure if she can contract human illnesses, but at least during the time I spent with her, I never noticed her coming down with any common illnesses or getting colds. However, she does seem to have subjective sensations of feeling better or worse at times, and I've even seen her oversleep when tired.

Despite all this data and evidence to suggest that she absolutely is human, there are many staff members who remain convinced that she's nothing more than an advanced AI... Isn't that way of thinking way too rigid? I have to convince them otherwise. Maybe the "Wisdom" part of the Wisdom Cube is a good place to start...

...We recently perform a combat test. All this time, I'd viewed Enterprise as identical to a typical human girl. However, everything changed the moment she put on the special equipment created from the same Wisdom Cubes that birthed her.

This equipment massively enhanced Enterprise's physical capabilities. Her strength, stamina, agility, every measurable statistic received an astonishing increase. As for the equipment itself... They bear the appearance of mini-sized naval-grade cannons and machine guns, but the staggering firepower they possess left all the on-site research staff speechless.
Who wouldn't be? After all, this girl, who for all intents and purposes is no different to any ordinary human being, commands power to rival that of fully equipped warships...

I consulted with the agency, and we came to the joint conclusion to name this special equipment "rigging." Just like Enterprise herself, it was created by exposing large quantities of materials to Wisdom Cubes, causing a resonance reaction that rearranged and reassembled the materials. The materials were entirely consumed in this process, leaving behind only the rigging after the resonance reaction completed. One can't help but wonder where the bulk of the materials' mass went...

On another topic, I'd like to propose reassigning some staff to research this subject exclusively. I'll also need to bring up the potential military applications of our discovery to Dr. Aoste's team...

Why were there museum artifacts among the materials at the site where Enterprise was born? Did they just happen to be there? Or did someone intentionally leave them there? I can't construct an explanation for either theory.

Who is this "Enterprise" anyway? That, too, is anyone's guess. Not even she can provide a clear explanation as to why that is her name, or why she claims to be an aircraft carrier, or why she knows so much about the actual ship, the Enterprise. She has no recollection of any events prior to her birth, for that matter.
It is true that she and her rigging share some visual similarities with the warship of the same name, and furthermore, that her rigging follows human warship design conventions of the same period while also using the same components (albeit scaled-down). Of course, it would be ludicrous to conclude that this girl IS Enterprise based on this evidence.

Attempting to answer these questions is likely to only lead one down a philosophical rabbit hole.
After all, who am I? What makes me Dr. Anzeel? What makes Dr. Aoste into Dr. Aoste?

The famous Ship of Theseus thought experiment asks a similar question. If one were to gradually replace every part of the ship, would it still be the Ship of Theseus?
If it's not the individual parts that make the ship into what it is, then what does? What gives a ship its "soul," so to speak?

More pertinent to the topic at hand, what is it that gives Enterprise her soul?

...The results of our 7-day long naval exercise are astounding. We already knew that Code G's combat potential rivals that of a modern capital ship based on our theoretical estimates, but her actual capabilities were in fact beyond our wildest expectations.

Code G is able to enlarge her rigging to launch and pilot dozens if not hundreds of aircraft entirely by herself. The offensive potential of her rigging surpasses that of multiple older fleet carriers combined. The aircraft she launched were comparable in size to remote-control planes, but despite this, they had all the firepower of their full-scale counterparts.

Her mobility and size, too, put traditional warships to shame.
Being only the size of an adult human female, she is able to board a vessel and launch surprise attacks from the deck. Furthermore, despite what her human appearance might lead one to speculate, with her rigging equipped she suffered no damage from both small arms fire and from shockwaves caused by explosions.

Larger weapons similarly proved ineffective against Code G. With a profile smaller than even an unmanned patrol boat, it is practically impossible to land a hit on her using naval cannons. When torpedoes were fired at Code G, she leapt over them, and when an attempt was made to hit her using a guided missile, she made a sharp turn and dodged it.
Code G's group, consisting of her and a handful of destroyers, were able to hold their own against 2 entire aircraft carrier task forces. This is an unbelievable feat, made all the more so by the fact that: 1) she is only just beginning to accustom herself to her rigging, and 2) she has yet to fully master conventional tactics.

Code G's rigging enlarging warrants further investigation. She had not shown this ability prior to this exercise.
Her power to somehow reconstruct her rigging is also of particular interest. It could, perhaps, lead to an answer to the question of what happened to all the materials that vanished from the test site...

However, because the exercises were scheduled several years before the regularly expected time period, military critics have claimed that this irregular event is an attempt to counter the joint exercises held by the Eagle Union and its allies.
Given the number of active warships in the Northern Parliament, experts estimate that over 800 warships will be participating in this exercise, an event of unprecedented scale.
From the previous exercises held ■ years ago, the world had already been flooded with the advent of Energy Cube technology and its derivative products, resulting in massive leaps in development across every faction. The Northern Parliament adapted in their own way, applying E-Cube technology in a completely different manner than the Eagle Union, successfully converting over 30% of their active fleet into being powered by E-Cubes, and this development will likely be the highlight of these naval exercises...

...The new weapon, Code G, which looks like a human girl born from a Cube, dropped a bombshell on the scientific community. Almost immediately, researchers across all disciplines began to argue over the fundamental question of its humanity— after all, how should one see an entity such as Code G, artificially born from an object, the Cube?
Naturally, no conference or forum around this "new technology" can avoid this basic proposition. Once this debate begins, however, there seldom seems to be an end to it. ...Currently, there are two predominant mainstream ideas:
The first is widely supported among researchers in academia, including Dr. Anzeel, a well-known Cube researcher: Code G was not born from a generic "Energy Cube," but rather from a special "Wisdom Cube," and because of the various characteristics and actions that "she" represents, she cannot be strictly considered a weapon, but is a "sentient and intelligent being" just like humans. In other words, they are to be considered citizens of their respective nations and as such, have basic human rights.
Meanwhile, high-level government officials and some researchers prefer to define this new weapon as high-performance artificial intelligence. Weapons builts from objects are to be considered as the protected property of the organization they come from, and though they are not programmed, they are still limited by dedicated rules and laws similar to AI, and thus considered "human-created intelligence."
An Eagle Union spokesperson agreed with the latter argument, saying that "[the KAN-SEN] are merely combat weapons with high-performance artificial intelligence and therefore should be treated in the same manner as weapons in accordance to management regulations."

..."Rigging" is a general term used for the equipment worn by the new KAN-SEN weapons, much like the armament broadly used by warships. Similarly, KAN-SEN are classified into destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, etc., according to differences in their rigging.
Rigging is equipped with modules that have the same functions as normal armament, such as naval artillery, torpedoes, and radars. Most of these modules are, as their name implies, miniature versions of real-life weapons, but some seem like they come straight out of science fiction. Rigging cannot be operated by ordinary humans, but are considered indispensable for KAN-SEN. Only when equipped with rigging do KAN-SEN gain power comparable to a warship.
The first rigging, like the KAN-SEN, was believed to have been developed from a Wisdom Cube (likely an evolution of a military-grade E-Cube). However, as research progressed, it became clear that certain modules could be separated from the rigging and interchanged freely, and soon after the first KAN-SEN was built, alternative rigging modules and manufacturing techniques were discovered. Currently, the method of manufacturing rigging is kept confidential by each faction, so a civilian researcher like myself can only speculate, but... I can guess that the Wisdom Cube is still involved in the production of these modules.
Rigging maintenance and modernization play important roles in the upkeep of a KAN-SEN's combat capabilities. Future KAN-SEN technological competition will revolve around the R&D of these equipment modules...]],

…Its ability to learn is extraordinary. It has learned the basics of dozens of diverse sciences, ranging from social sciences, to humanities, to linguistics, to military theory. All in a short timeframe.

And that's not all. After every combat exercise, it writes its own reports, reviews its tactics, and adjusts its equipment, all on its own. Although it's on the whole not as efficient as a specialized military AI, it's able to make complicated decisions, and even appears to have original thoughts and ideas. These factors are what set it apart from all other currently available military AIs.

Personally, I have some qualms about dedicating precious time to making it study the liberal arts. Dr. Anzeel, however, asserts that doing so lets it more readily take in information and function in society at large. Sure, that's useful for espionage or fleeing a warzone to blend in with civilians, but considering the AI's expected service life, we should be focusing on more important things.

More and more combat units of the same type as Code G have begun appearing recently. Their advantages over last-generation war machines are so numerous that the two are almost categorically uncomparable. They are even quicker to produce, too.

The scale of the lab's research grows with each passing day. The 3 facilities are situated on an island in a far-off corner of the sea. This remote location was ideal for ensuring secrecy during the project's first stage, though there is no longer any need to hide the existence of Code G and her sisters from the world.
At present, the combat units are engaged in logistics transports and combat exercises at an esteemed naval base. This base conducts round-the-clock research into new weapons and serves as a training ground.

One question regarding the combat units arose during their transfer into the navy – should the navy address them by their established codenames, or their "true" names? Dr. Anzeel posits the navy should use their "true" names, but Naval HQ disagrees on the matter, stating potential confusion arising from a combat unit having the same name as a warship in active service as their basis.

Why? Because it symbolizes that the navy formally acknowledges Enterprise as an individual and commends her on all her efforts up to this point.

This event is going to set a historical precedent. Enterprise, and others like her born from Wisdom Cubes, are officially being recognized as people. Not as instruments of war or mere AIs created by man, but as people.

...And now, a news story from the Royal Islands. Since the start of the month, fishermen have reported finding what they described as "strange machines" in their hauls. The size of these machines has ranged from as long as nearly 3 meters, to as short as around 45 centimeters. They outwardly resemble deep-sea fish, with camouflage patterns imprinted on their scale-like exteriors. What's more, these exteriors seem to be made from a material that makes them almost impossible to detect by radar.

Many of the fishermen have claimed that, despite not weighing much and not having particularly thick scales, they are nevertheless extremely durable. One fisherman reportedly struck a machine with a harpoon and was shocked to find the impact hadn't left as much as a scratch on it. The Royal Society has taken charge of these machines for the time being and plans to conduct further analysis on them.

Some civilian scholars speculate that the machines are unmanned reconnaissance drones belonging to hostile forces, believing the larger machines to be central control systems for the smaller machines which do the reconnaissance. As for the reason why they were hauled up in Royal Islands waters, some have theorized they may have malfunctioned and simply drifted there, but nobody knows for certain.

Military experts have weighed in too, pointing out that the machines' distinct appearance is unlike any drone known to exist. They have further cited that the material the machines' exterior are made of, as well as the camouflage patterns painted on them, do not match those of any military drones in active service today...]],

...A large fleet of 400 warships from various factions has already gathered in the NA Area to prepare for tomorrow's navy-military joint exercises.
This is the third navy-military joint exercise to be held this year, and is the largest so far this year.
Unlike in the previous exercises, the new KAN-SEN weapons account for over half of the ships in the fleets present, and as a result, the general fleets, which have long been a major source of military might, have now been relegated to a supporting role to the dazzling KAN-SEN. According to the currently available information, the main purpose of this exercise is to familiarize the fleets with the KAN-SEN and to seek out new tactics.
The exercises are divided into solo exercises for KAN-SEN, joint exercises between general fleets and KAN-SEN, counter exercises between general fleets and KAN-SEN, counter exercises between KAN-SEN, and a final large-scale fleet review.
According to a spokesperson, this exercise is an annual naval review and has no political implications...]],

To Aoste,

...To be frank, the question as to whether or not artificial intelligence will eventually supersede humanity is not one I have an answer for.

From an evolutionary perspective, natural selection dictates that all organisms fight for survival, with the fittest species among them surviving. By these rules, countless species have risen and fallen, and there is no guarantee that humans will be the ultimate victors.

But before talking about "superseding," we must first ask if AI can fit into the definition of living organisms.

One definition of a living organism is a self-evolving system that can spontaneously undergo entropic changes for the purpose of promulgating itself. In a broader sense, the process of producing new individuals based on itself can be called "reproduction." Under this definition, the "vector" of life itself is not as important as its ability to undergo self-evolution in response to stochastic changes in entropy.

Ultimately, I agree with the view that any system, whether biological or artificially created, can be considered a living organism as long as it has a sense of self and is capable of thought. In other words, a true AI is in fact a living organism - and that's a hill I'm willing to die on.

But things get more complicated when you dig deeper. If the purpose of AI is to create a living organism that has a sense of self similar to humans but with greater cognitive capacity, will that lifeform be superior to humans? And will it "replace" us?

If true AI did exist, how do you think it would answer this question?

Looking forward to your response,

Anzeel,

...I don't deny that emotions are a requisite component of "true" AIs, but I would like to offer a few remarks regarding the topics of emotions, metacognition, and the definition of life that you have raised.

First and foremost, when considering the process of evoking emotions from memories, human beings can experience a gamut of emotions by retrieving memories stored in the brain. We know that AIs can replicate this process if they have the same cognitive protocols of storage and retrieval.

The problem is, memories stored in the human brain can deteriorate or change over time, and the technology to implant or manipulate those memories are still a pipe dream at this point. The inverse is true when it comes to artificial intelligence. Information stored in AI databanks does not degrade over time, and it is well within our technological capacity to input and manipulate that data. In other words, AI memories can be created synthetically.

Following this logic, emotions in AI can reliably be created by inputting a specific set of memories. Don't you think your idea of having them imitate human growth and development to accumulate "memories" is somewhat inefficient?

Best,

Anzeel,

...Sorry about last time. I had no idea you were so invested in that topic.

Regarding my commentary about artificial intelligence at that time, I definitely could have been more careful with my choice of words. Even in a hypothetical environment, if we are to treat AI as living organisms, we must not ignore the fundamental rights to which they are entitled.

You are right - just like humans, an AI's memory is also valuable. If it were possible to perfectly manipulate human memories, that would spell the end of human civilization. However, if true AI is to exist in this world, there is another problem that we must first solve.

I'd like to discuss this topic with you further over dinner tonight, if you don't mind. How about Granate? It's not too far away, and their paella is absolutely divine. Let's meet up at the university's main entrance after classes are over today. I've come up with a few things that might be of interest to you.

Dear Colonel Archer,

...As a researcher, I consider Enterprise as more than just an experimental subject to observe. She's also my child.

I can't even begin to express how proud of her I am, which is why I'm also worried about her future. I am just a mere scientist who knows little more than research and experimentation, but I can sense the power that girl has and the impact she will have on the entire world.

And if that power were to be used for war... If even I know about it, how can you, the military, not also know?

That is why I want to hear your thoughts about this whole thing. You're the most upstanding officer I know in the military, so... what does the Federation think of Enterprise? How much do they plan to intervene in this research? In other words, when do they plan to send her off to war?

...I know that day will come, sooner or later. I just hope that on that day, she will step onto the battlefield as a soldier and compatriot, rather than as some sort of weapon. Please, give these girls the rights and the glory they deserve.

I look forward to hearing from you.

To Dr. Anzeel:

...First of all, we fully understand your concerns, and I would like to personally meet with you to discuss these issues.

The bottom line is, the military is already aware of your research and will make their move soon. The timeline has been shifted up - the power demonstrated by Code G during that exercise was just as shocking to them as it was to me.

However, there is a silver lining to all this. The question of her status is still being discussed, and there is no immediate plan to use her on the battlefield. Very likely, the question of mass producibility is the military's top priority at this moment. If Wisdom Cubes can be constructed more efficiently, there will undoubtedly be a new military revolution that fundamentally overturns centuries of human warfare. They will redefine military doctrine for the next hundred years.

Rest assured, Doctor. We will do everything we can to improve the treatment of Code G so that she is seen as a warrior, rather than as a weapon.

Dear Colonel Archer,

Division 13, the special mooring and safekeeping facility established to bridge the gap between shipgirls and humans and develop mutual rapport, has finally paid off after so much hard work. After the commencement ceremony, Enterprise, as well as all other shipgirls, will finally be recognized as people just like us, not solely weapons of war.

Enterprise is not the type to wear her heart on her sleeves, and I've long been worried that she wouldn't be able to handle all the pressure that's been building up. But after seeing her confidence and the smile on her face today, my worries completely flew away.

Of course, our work is far from over. This achievement is only the first step of many, and the next step is to push for the revision of certain laws and policies as soon as possible. Until the rights of shipgirls are recognized in the same way human rights are, we cannot truly feel at ease.

But... I'm still worried about the current geopolitical situation. We've been locked in a tense stalemate for quite a long time now... Colonel, is war with the Revolutionary Front inevitable?

To Dr. Anzeel:

Your concern is understandable, but I believe cooler heads will prevail.

As you know, the Federation's military officers are rather hawkish, but nobody wants another full-blown World War to break out. Cube technology has been improving our lives day by day, and we can't just throw that all away. As far as I can tell, the other side has already shifted the brunt of their research toward environmental remodeling projects.

Having that said, I would expect this push-and-pull to continue for a period of time, given that none of us can envision reconciliation any time soon...

I do believe your heart is in the right place, Doctor, and I will do everything in my capacity to support your cause. I may not be able to change any laws, but I can introduce you to a number of my more politically-involved acquaintances. Given that election season is in full swing, once the savvier politicians get a glimpse of the potential of the shipgirls, they will be sure to support us.

On an unrelated note, have you heard about the "major earthquake" that occurred in the Bermudas? While I was digging for information on some classified servers, I encountered a "strange problem" that you might be able to shed some light on.

Last but not least, how is Enterprise doing these days? I haven't heard anything about her and the other girls from the Naval HQ recently, but I'd love to hear more about them the next time we get the chance.

Dear Colonel Archer,
I don't know how else to put this, but you have a dangerous situation on your hands.
There's not a lot of information for me to work with right now, but I can say one thing for sure: the energy that destroyed your unmanned submarines was not of natural origin. This energy might've been amplified by the seismic waves, but it also could've caused the earthquake to begin with.
The damage caused by this phenomenon is also extremely concerning to me. You may have already noticed this already, but the newer, E-Cube-powered submarines sustained more damage than submarines powered by traditional energy sources.
In any case, there is nothing I can do without first obtaining all of your research documents. If that's too much to ask for, then I at least need to know what experiments your team was performing with the Wisdom Cubes, or what modifications were made to the cubes during their work.
I won't have any definitive answers until I get to see the damages to the submarine cores in person, so I've submitted an application for an on-site investigation. Colonel, this is a warning: you must not allow the military to make any rash moves before I elucidate the nature of this energy.
Lastly, I would appreciate it if you could nudge the application process forward a bit faster.
I look forward to hearing from you.

To Dr. Anzeel:
I understand your concerns, but unfortunately, we don't have enough time left.
Our experiments in the Bermudas over the past few days have attracted the attention of the Revolutionary Front.
We have reliable intel that the Northern Parliament submarines that went missing just a few days prior have appeared in our vicinity. Additionally, the RF has mobilized its fleet stationed in the Antilles. I suspect that, in a matter of days to weeks, we will be surrounded by our "friendly" neighbors who plan to conduct exercises "with no particular target in mind."
Our problems also don't end there. Firstly, the army's opinions are divided on how to ensure your safety in light of the RF's activity. Secondly, the issue of how to move the large equipment you need for your investigation to the salvage site is also still being carefully evaluated. After all, our goals will be completely exposed once the RF sees the equipment.
In any case, I will try my best to get you permission for an on-site investigation, but best case scenario, it'll have to occur simultaneously with the salvage operation.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

Quarterly Report:
■ Quarter ■■ Situation Report ■■ City Police Department
The number of incidents this quarter increased by 476% from the previous quarter, with a significant increase after the Bermuda disaster. Among them, two types of incidents have had a sharp uptick in frequency.
1) Incidents caused by malfunction of electronic equipment throughout the jurisdiction. Power outages, explosions, fires, sudden shutdowns or malfunctions of various electronic devices such as medical equipment, including causes not limited to loss of power or unstable power supply. Due to a wide variety of equipment and models affected, we have eliminated the possibility of manufacturing defects in specific products as a cause for this uptick. The possibility of terrorism cannot be ruled out.

2) Violent crime. A particularly notable trend is a tendency to commit violent acts in a state of mental confusion. Additionally, according to some of the officers on-site, similar testimony has been provided by eyewitnesses confirming the presence of this phenomenon. In addition to a general deterioration in public safety following the disaster, it has been pointed out that a new hallucinogenic drug has started flowing into the city, and is likely related to the uptick in these incidents. Investigations into the composition of the drug are currently underway.

We would like to propose several measures to combat the deterioration of public safety following the disaster.
1) Mitigate the failure of electronic equipment by inspecting the city's infrastructure, repairing problematic areas, and replacing parts as necessary.
2) Request federal assistance in order to strengthen investigations into potential terrorist activities targeting electronic devices and infrastructure, as well investigations into the new hallucinogenic drugs.
3) Due to the tsunami's contamination of the urban water supply, that a public health emergency be declared, and to request research institutes in and around the district to cooperate with this investigation.

Several geologists made remarks in support of this statement, expressing their view that earthquakes of this sort with a shallow epicenter and extremely strong seismic intensity are rare but not unheard of.

A salvage company's contractual breach may be a major setback to the ocean economy
––View Full Article––

Recently, a major salvage company breached a contract in a way that has caught the attention of marine-based businesses around the world.

According to a notice posted on the official website of the Hercules Ocean Exploration Company, the lease agreement of certain salvage vessels under the company's name was temporarily terminated due to internal shifts in the company. Certain lawyers have pointed out that this unreasonable unilateral contractual termination will result in a massive penalty that, based on the company's financial data from its previous fiscal year, the Hercules Company will be unable to pay.

However, at the time of this article's publication, the Hercules Ocean Exploration Company's stock price has remained stable, and the company's board of directors has already released a public statement that the liquidation for the penalty was already completed at the end of the aforementioned lease agreement. It is unclear at this time how the company managed to raise this amount of money, but according to someone familiar with the company's internal operations, an "unnamed individual" provided crucial assistance in paying off this sum.

The company's fleet featured a new model of salvage ship powered by the E-Cube, and these ships quickly made a major impact on the global salvaging business. However, the company's withdrawal from this sector could be a prime opportunity for other businesses to step in. This need is even more evident, as governments around the world have been dedicating large amounts of time and resources into researching and raising sunken ships...]],

An undersea earthquake of unknown cause occurred in the Bermudas today, creating a tsunami that inflicted severe damage to our floating dock. Several research vessels were also lost in the tsunami's wake.
Fortunately, our communication lines were successfully reestablished after a brief downtime. Repairs to the dock are also underway.
Experts say this type of earthquake is "exceedingly rare" and the seismic waves were "unprecedented"... Those damn crackpot scientists. I've heard about their weird experiments on the platform, and now look what's happened!
Those research vessels have something to do with that earthquake, mark my words...

In conclusion, the earthquake was indeed not of natural origin.
While all equipment near the epicenter suffered severe damage, some measuring instruments in the floating dock did manage to survive the event. The data recovered from these instruments show that another earthquake, lower in intensity and with a shallower hypocenter, occurred 90 seconds before the "main" earthquake.
At present, the most probable scenario is that, prior to the earthquake, there was a tremendous burst of energy at the location believed to be the hypocenter. This immediately destroyed the research platform and subsequently caused the earthquake.
With our analysis of the recovered data and examination of the affected area, we have identified the cause of the energy burst.

Despite the diver taking every possible safety precaution during this salvage operation, his health monitoring systems triggered an alarm within about ten minutes after entering the wreckage.
After his rescue, it was discovered that all his electronic equipment was broken, and the diver showed signs of extreme mental disturbance. The diver has since been transferred to the nearest research institute for treatment and observation.

…The convoy sent to refloat the platform broadcasted a distress signal before all contact was lost. Naval servicemen stationed on the floating dock near the disaster site were immediately dispatched to investigate and begin a rescue mission.

According to a sergeant who was among the first responders, only a handful of the several dozen vessels in the convoy were found, and all of those vessels were either on fire or had capsized.

Thanks to the heroic efforts of the rescue team, one sole survivor was found inside a freezer aboard a salvage vessel that sustained comparatively little damage. Unfortunately, this survivor displayed severe mental disturbance and was transported to the nearest research facility for medical observation and treatment. The individual remains in an uncommunicative state.

A follow-up investigation revealed numerous signs of fighting aboard the salvage ship, suggesting that a riot had broken out immediately before the incident. Findings indicate that a person had set fire to the galley, which then spread throughout the rest of the ship. It is possible that this riot is connected to the outbreaks of mass hysteria reported on the East Coast.

The records gathered from the ship suggest that, just prior to the incident, the crew had managed to recover an object of substantial importance from the sunken platform. As this object was not found aboard the ship during the investigation, it is likely that it sunk to the ocean floor once again...]],

"...Reporting from the lawn of the W.H. The administration has announced that it will shortly be holding a press conference on "Bon Homme Richard" on this lawn.
As you may know, following an award ceremony that was broadcast to the whole world, the girls born from Wisdom Cubes came to gradually gain acceptance throughout the world. Because information about these girls has been classified as confidential by all countries with access to the technology, the amount of intel we're able to access is unfortunately very limited.
However, that might finally change today! Just now, a spokesperson from the administration confirmed that the information disclosed on the official Navy social media account is true. This ship - or rather, young lady - by the name of Bon Homme Richard, has officially entered the Eagle Union's Navy, and the administration has promised to make more information available at the press conference!
Currently, the administration spokesperson has just appeared, my friends... By God, the person following the speaker...! Photographer, photographer! Turn the camera to that girl! Yes, that girl, she's the very same person in that photo posted by the Navy's account! Wow, she's even waving at us... Talk about unexpected!
The spokesperson is introducing us to Miss Richard – wait, am I hearing this right? The official spokesperson of the Eagle Union Navy?! For the viewers back home, this is certainly a surprising turn of events! Miss Richard has disclosed that she indeed will be one of the spokespeople for the Navy..."]],

Not only that, but the ceremony has also set off waves of heated discussion across all major social media platforms. It seems like the world cannot quench its thirst for information about the young woman known as "Bon Homme Richard."
Even though the existence of the shipgirls has come to be widely accepted, and new fleets led by Enterprise have become more and more visible to the public eye, there are still many people - and organizations - skeptical about them. They are convinced that the so-called "shipgirls" are nothing more than a large-scale government propaganda campaign, and the true identity of the "shipgirls" are none other than ordinary human girls. One individual claiming to "expose" the true identity of Bon Homme Richard has published a lengthy article to a personal site, featuring a litany of "evidence" to support these claims. However, judging from the responses, this lengthy article is full of logical fallacies and only serves to strengthen the opposite position.
We asked Miss Richard herself on what she thought about this article and related claims via her official social media account, and she responded only with this statement: "Many choose to believe that the Earth is flat. Does that make them any more correct?"

For a long time, the stark contrast between the city's former glory and its condition in recent years has become a symbol of decay, with everything seemingly on the brink of collapse. However, after the arrival of the E-Cube industry, this place was granted a new lease on life. With the E-Cube at its heart, the city rapidly pulled itself out from its dire straits by embracing a brand new automotive industry, bringing clean-energy cars to the world while also reversing unemployment rates in a way economists could only describe as "miraculous."
To celebrate the city's revitalization, the city council decided to once again hold the city fair that had been suspended for many years. While the fair is guaranteed to have a wide range of offerings, the highlight of the event undoubtedly will be the E-Cube vehicle street racing event. The fair organizer previously stated that there would be a mysterious guest who wished to remain anonymous, but will also be participating in the race along with the city's residents."

Many locals at the scene said that they saw a female racecar driver suspected to be 'Miss Richard,' and a local reporter even took a blurry photo.

Missile false alarm terrifies local residents
Today at 8:07 AM (HS-AI Time Zone), an emergency broadcast was issued to all residents of H.S. State, with the following message: "A nuclear missile is approaching H.S. State. A nuclear missile is approaching H.S. State. Please enter your nearest bunker immediately. This is not a drill."
This was quickly identified as a false alarm, and three minutes later, the Oceanic Federation Command notified the National Guard that there was no incoming missile.

At 8:18 AM, 11 minutes later, the state government corrected the notification and issued another emergency broadcast stating that the previous broadcast was a false alarm. The H.S. Emergency Preparedness Service said that the alert was sent out due to staff error, but this incident had already caused a number of problems, adding to the state's already turbulent year.

Users on the internet were quick to make fun of this incident, but for the locals, the false alarm was nothing short of terrifying and mind-boggling. Almost immediately, people began drawing parallels between the series of inexplicable accidents and the mysterious incident at the training site in the Bermudas.

Can the gag orders issued by the Oceanic Federation and the Revolutionary Front really prevent the widespread societal unrest from deteriorating further?

Host: Now with the world's attention focused on the tension between the Oceanic Federation and the Revolutionary Front, how likely do you think it is that we'll get another global war in the near future?

Expert: This is war we're talking about, and I think a lot of these concerns are overblown. If either side truly wanted to start a war, the day of the accident would've been the best time to do it. But despite that, both sides have actually demonstrated more restraint since the accident, increasing the distance between their fleets with no signs of saber-rattling present.

Host: Who do you think has the upper hand right now?

Expert: Given the strength of the forces on both sides, it's truly difficult to say which is superior... One popular view is that because the strength of the training fleets stationed in the Bermudas is evenly matched, this balance of power has largely suppressed the possibility of an actual confrontation.

Host: There have been rumors circulating around that the Federation's fleet has suffered serious damage due to the accident.

Expert: You hear plenty of conspiracy theories out there, but rumors are just that - rumors. Hypothetically speaking, if the Federation's fleet had suffered so much damage, there would be no reason for the Revolutionary Front to hide that information.

Host: Thank you. Next, I'd like to talk about the missile false alarm incident in H.S. the other day...

...Our dear viewers, we have news from our on-site reporter. At 14 minutes past midnight, the meeting with the Revolutionary Front regarding the chain of incidents in the Bermudas came to a close.

A representative of the Northern Parliament's armed forces stated that the Revolutionary Front's meeting with the Oceanic Federation was "constructive and friendly." After both sides had provided their accounts, they said that the rising tension in the Bermudas was all caused by "a series of misunderstandings."

Our reporter was told that the confrontation there ended peacefully, and that the rumors about both sides preparing for war were completely false.

A high-ranking Oceanic Federation official confirmed this statement and went on to praise the Northern Parliament for its measured, peace-promoting stance on the matter. This official also said that both parties are fully committed to maintaining world peace, and that a hotline between the two sides has been established to help prevent similar confrontations in the future.

Both the Revolutionary Front and the Oceanic Federation have signed a memorandum concerning this matter. More details will follow later this afternoon...]],

Resolution Establishing the Richard Incident Investigation Committee

...Per the Department of Defense's request, a special investigation committee is to be established in service of researching the chain of accidents caused by Division 13 KAN-SEN Bon Homme Richard during Oceanic Federation military exercises on ■■/■■/■■■■. Furthermore, by their suggestion, this will henceforth be referred to as the Richard Affair.

The committee will consist of a total of 144 members in relevant fields, including personnel from the Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Executive Office, as well as select representatives from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, Federal Council and Secretariats, Military Affairs Committee, and National Academy of Sciences.

The investigation committee will be headquartered on Samos Island. The first meeting is to be held before ■■/■■ this year, though the exact date is to be decided based on the progress of the preliminary investigation.

Until the aforementioned meeting, executive authority of the committee will be held by three representatives, one from each of the Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Executive Office.

After the passage of this resolution, leadership of the committee will, on behalf of the committee:
1. Have full authority and responsibility over the investigation of this affair.
2. Designate Samos Island and the surrounding region as a control zone and evacuate all except members of the committee.
3. On a weekly basis...

—Report by: Master Sergeant Simon Winster
- 9:00
- The salvage operation is nearly complete.
- We ended up making more of a mess down here than there was to begin with.
- It's the kind of joke nobody can laugh at...
- I don't know what this "box" we're salvaging now is, but it's got fleets from half of the entire world coming for it.
...
- 16:22
- Hold fast and take it slow! That's right, just like any other fishing trip!
- Damn it all! Who's ever heard of every machine in the operation breaking?! And damn the idiot who decided we have to haul this thing up with sheer manpower!
- Don't lose your head! I can see the robot arm shaking from here!
- How many times have I told you to stop believing every conspiracy theory you see on the internet?!
- Take this sensor, read those numbers properly, and make sure you remember them. Then, our job's done. Got it?
- What's that? You said the sensor's broken? Hell, I'm not even surprised at this point.
- Our shift's about done. I'll tell the guys on the next shift to bring a new sensor.
...
- 03:17
- Come again? You want me to hand that box over to Division 13?
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the order I was given. I don't care if the general told you...
- This is... O-oh, nevermind then.
- Right this way, Miss Richard. Let's finish up this shift change!]],

Bon Homme Richard
@Richard_NavyOfficial  – 1 month ago
Here I come, Samos Island~!
Maybe you've heard the news, but I got a temporary transfer to Division 13 to join the Oceanic Federation's military exercise in the Bermudas!
(If you haven't heard, click this link here!)
I won't be able to post after the exercise starts, so this is my last message until this thing is gone!

P.S., For the next five hours after this post, I'll be on Samos for one last bit of fun in the sun before things get busy! If you happen to run into me, I'll be glad to give out autographs. No photos though!

Remember, everyone: No matter how busy you are, don't forget to enjoy yourself every now and then!]],

The subject of this recording is a survivor of the second fleet.
After rehabilitation, he has recovered enough to respond to basic questions, though he will sporadically lapse into an abnormal state.
As such, it is difficult to confirm the veracity of his testimony.

- Do you remember your name?
-- N-no... Don't come any closer!
- Calm down, my friend. I'm going to stay outside. I won't come in.
- Do you remember what happened before you fell into the water?
-- It was a tornado! That's it, I saw it... A black tornado!
-- Ahahahahah! She said she'd destroy everything! She said she was going to take me away!
- Who is "she?"
-- Bon Homme Richard! I saw her smiling! I heard her whispering to me!
- So... Bon Homme Richard was inside the black tornado, and she smiled and spoke to you?
-- No! No, no, no, no! You don't know, you don't know anything! She WAS the black tornado! The tornado smiled and talked to me!
-- But then, I fell in the water, and... I don't remember anything after that.
- Thank you. Get some rest, my friend.

- Your cooperation is much appreciated, Colonel [bleep]. Could you start by telling us about what was happening at the time?
-- Show me that investigation warrant again first.
-- Alright, it looks authentic. Fair warning, though, I don't know that I can give you a full picture of the entire incident.
-- Put this on the record not as absolute fact, but as a personal perspective.
- Of course. Now, I'd like you to begin.
-- (silence)
-- That day... the sixth and second fleets were dispatched on a joint mission, per the exercise plan. But then, we... heard a huge explosion far away.
-- At first, I'd thought that it was a misfired missile, or the RF had started their bombardment exercise nearby. But we realized it came from a Division 13 ship next to the second fleet. Their flagship had... exploded, I guess.
-- Actually, exploded isn't the right word. When we turned around, their flagship was just gone. In its place was a black tornado, out of nowhere.
- Did this black tornado attack our fleet?
-- I can't say for certain, but... That thing did start moving toward the nearest warship. Almost like it had a mind of its own. And then, we got a message from the second fleet's flagship. They said, "Stamp out rebellion."
-- From there, the black tornado grew into a large-scale hurricane that enveloped the RF's fleet along with us. That was when utter chaos broke out. Everyone started firing on each other until they sank. It was so horrifying that I thought it was the onset of a new world war...
- Was the sixth fleet you were in affected by the black tornado?
-- There was enough distance between us and the black tornado to let us get away, but shortly after the tornado appeared, all our gauges and electronics malfunctioned. Then, our communication equipment went down, followed by the power system, and then—[bleep]—]],

- It's a pleasure to meet you. I believe you are Colonel Archer's father, Philip?
-- You know damn well who I am. You people transferred us here in the first place.
- My apologies, sir, but consider it a formality. We were given orders to bring your family here for protection purposes. You may know this already, but I'm a friend of John's. I volunteered for this mission myself.
-- Sure, I know that. But I've got nothing to tell you. John hasn't come back in a long time, and he never talks about work in the first place.
......
- Mrs. Archer, I have a question for you now. Have you noticed anything unusual about your husband?
-- Of course not! I haven't seen him in so long. If there's anything unusual, it's that you refuse to tell me anything about him.
-- What in the world happened to my John?
- We're trying to figure that out too, ma'am. That's why we need your cooperation.
-- I know you won't tell me, but he was part of some secret plan, wasn't he? Something must have happened to him, right?!
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but if you'd please just answer me...
......
-- There was an accident in the Bermudas; it's all over the internet, you know.
- If you watched the news, you would know that those are baseless rumors.
-- Is that so? Then why did you cut off the internet at our apartment? You even had our cell service shut off! Scared of us learning something, huh?
- It was a necessary precaution to keep everyone safe.
- Ahem... Hello, young man. You are Colonel Archer's son, yes? I have some questions—

- So, you received a message from the Enterprise, then cooperated with the Revolutionary Front in a joint operation. Is that correct?
-- That is correct.
- Do you understand that not only was this operation unauthorized, but also that Captain Archer of the Enterprise did not have the authority to bypass the flagship and give you orders directly?
-- Do you have any idea what kind of situation we were in, Mr. Investigator?
-- The second fleet was burning up and there was a massive storm raging. Our comms were completely busted. You can't maintain radio contact with the flagship when every man is fighting just to stay alive. Do you understand what I'm saying? The chain of command had completely and utterly disintegrated.
-- What Captain Archer did was take over command to reorganize the fleet and mount a counterattack. Did I obey his orders, you ask? Yes. And I would do it again.
-- I would follow any order if it would get us out of that hellscape alive.
- Did Captain Archer contact the Revolutionary Front first? Did he tell them he wished to cooperate?
-- No. They contacted him. I think they wanted revenge for their fallen comrades, just as we did.
- You said he intended to "mount a counterattack." Against what, exactly? The tornado, a force of nature? If so, are you implying he already knew what had caused the incident?
-- Mr. Investigator... What are you getting at?
-- If you're trying to get me to incriminate Captain Archer, then I will not answer any more of your questions.
