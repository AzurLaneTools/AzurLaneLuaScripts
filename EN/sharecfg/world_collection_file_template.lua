One example is the mysterious ■■■■■■ Explosion that occurred in Northern Parliament territory. \nOn ■■/■■/■■■■ at daybreak, there was a huge explosion comparable to a nuclear detonation in the western part of the Northern Parliament, completely destroying a forested region of greater than 20■■ square kilometers. The cause of this mysterious explosion has attracted the attention of countless scientists and scholars for a century. Though many hypotheses have been proposed, no consensus has been reached by the academic community, and this case remains an unresolved historical mystery. \nJust when the world had begun to slowly forget about it, scientists made shocking progress in recent days by relying on the cutting-edge technology to re-explore the ancient ■■■■■■ area.

...After an investigation, it was concluded that the massive explosion that occurred in Northern Parliament territory was most likely caused by a meteorite impact. This is generally consistent with the long-held Aerolith Hypothesis, but the actual situation is quite a bit different from what the hypothesis posited. 
The most suspicious aspect of the ■■■■■■ Explosion: 
At least three powerful explosions occurred simultaneously, and three craters were identified. However, no meteorite fragments were found at the scene. 
Though the Aerolith Hypothesis can explain the incident to some extent, this piece of evidence is what prevented this theory from being broadly accepted. However, the latest research finally proposed a reasonable explanation to what happened to the meteorite fragments. 
Research showed that meteorites that hit the earth first broke up into several pieces due to mesospheric friction, thus forming three separate explosion craters. Additionally, according to calculations, the three impact sites in the ■■■■■■ region may only represent the impact points of some of these fragments; other meteorites whose orbits were changed during atmospheric entry have a high probability of having fallen into the polar regions. Due to the special qualities of these meteorite fragments, they may have quickly “melted” into the surrounding environment. Therefore, the actual fragments have not been found at the impact sites, resulting in the mystery that still persists today...]],

However, following this paper, countless reporters, researchers, explorers, and tourists from all over the league flocked to the forest where the meteorite impacts remain. 
According to customs officials, over the last three months, the number of scientific research entry applications increased more than a hundred times compared to the same period in previous years, with all other types of applications also increasing significantly.

Unlike with conventional energy sources, the most important thing about producing ε-Cubes is the construction of a complex synthetic container. Differences in specifications during the production process of this container will directly affect the quality of the resulting ε-Cube. At the Summit, scientists carried out extensive discussions of the experimental data published by various countries, finally formulating a series of standards to produce a stable and reliable ε-Cube.

...Waste disposal and recycling have been one of humanity's hardest-to-solve problems for years. As the chemical compounds that form a cornerstone of our modern society grow increasingly complex, the primitive method of disposing of them in landfills starts to become infeasible, while microbes capable of decomposing waste products are unable to satisfy even a tiny fraction of global demand. Recycling, meanwhile, is crippled by its elaborate and costly sorting processes, and thus the percentage of waste being recycled globally has remained low.

At present, the most popular waste disposal method is concentrated incineration in special-made compartments. This allows for the maximum amount of energy possible to be extracted from the waste. Afterwards, the residue goes through several steps of processing, including one step wherein metal components are retrieved and collected.
Regardless, due to the sheer number of Cube energy farms that have been constructed, waste-burning energy production has become a high-cost, low-profit industry. As a result, we face a dilemma where more and more waste treatment facilities are forced to close down, even though we need them.

There is a silver lining, however. Cubes created this conundrum, but they can also solve it. As Cubes are a practically free energy source,

...Cubes, being a compact energy source, were seemingly the perfect solution to the power supply question faced by many engineers working on Powered Combat Suit (PCS) projects around the world. Tests have showed the Cubes not only extend a PCS's maximum operational time, they also provide it with enhanced mobility and an astounding increase in speed.
Due to the limitations of last-generation energy supply solutions, old PCS models were semi-open designs created to be as lightweight as possible. As these models were unable to provide their user with full-body protection, they only saw extremely limited usage.
After the breakthroughs of Cube technology, this fundamental problem became all but a non-issue. PCS design has undergone a complete reversal with the latest generation, with most models favoring a casing that fully encloses the operator. These suits put emphasis on increased firepower and armor, life-support for missions in hazardous environments, and systems that raise the operator's tactical awareness. The PCS, once merely an auxiliary combat aide, has transformed into a literal war machine.
This rapid development has sparked debate among engineers over the PCS's fundamental design, however. Some argue the bipedal model designed around the human body is here to stay, while others propose switching to wheeled vehicle-type designs featuring superior stability. Others still ponder the feasibility of leveraging the Cubes' almost inexhaustible energy to create suits with "wings"...]],

...The FNH Group's new model of heavy machine gun, the FNCB4, has passed inspection and is scheduled for adoption by the military soon. The FNCB4 has an integrated miniature Cube which continuously provides the weapon's other components with energy. This grand departure from long-standing HMG design tradition allowed for many innovations that take advantage of the Cube technology's abundant energy, such as kinetic energy accelerators embedded in the barrel, and a ballistic trajectory correction device built into in the weapon's sights, among others.

The HMG can be further categorized into one of 8 models based on intended use, most notably:
- FNCB4A, for use by infantry
- FNCB4B, for use in Powered Combat Suits
- FNCB4F, for use by large drones
- FNCB4H, for use on unmanned warships

7 out of 8 models cleared all tests; testing of model FNCB4B has been postponed due to a malfunction with the testing platform. The remaining 7 models are all slated to enter mass-production.
The FNH Group's most high-profile weapons project, a high-energy laser weapon powered by Cube technologies, did not make an appearance at this round of testing. When asked about this, the public relations manager at FNH Group informed us the weapon is still in the testing phase...]],

...The Northern Parliament will once again be sending their tried and tested nuclear-powered space shuttle on a resupply mission to Space Station Emir. The shuttle will be delivering the regular cargo consisting of food supplies and research equipment, in addition to 3 medium-sized supplementary Cube power units.
Once they have been successfully installed, these units will then provide the station's existing installations with additional output.

The Northern Parliament intends to install additional Cube power units on the station in the future and further expand the Emir's operational scope.
Additionally, a Northern Parliament space program representative announced that plans are in the works to construct a new docking platform that would allow the station to store and launch probes into deep-space. These probes are currently under development and will be powered with Cube technology.

Upon review of both nuclear-powered and Cube-powered space shuttles for use in low-Earth orbit, scientists found that Cube-powered shuttles do not have any significant advantages over their older nuclear-powered counterparts. In light of these findings, many organizations have announced plans to invest research into Cube-powered deep-space probes that can take off directly from space station docking platforms instead...]],

More like they're rolling out a testbed of a converted light tank. The specs are all classified, so it's anyone's guess how it actually performs in combat. It's pretty much the same size based on the pics they've released to the public so far too, so my educated guess is the only major change is the new compact cube engine is gonna open up space and improve crew comfort.

...This article provides information about the "ECHO Plan" recently unveiled by the X.O.S. Chamber of Commerce. Based on the published materials, the "ECHO Plan" is divided into three stages, but so far only the first two have been disclosed publicly.
In the first stage, the Chamber of Commerce will mobilize R&D resources and talent to achieve breakthroughs in Cube technology and applications in the aviation sector. Currently, Cube-powered engines can only be used in large stationary machines and small to medium-sized ground vehicles. If this development goes smoothly, engines for large drones will be developed first, followed by engines for passenger planes and freight, then finally, engines for combat aircraft. Imagine the joys of flying without a need to refuel.
The completion of the first stage of the plan will revolutionize the traditional aviation industry, leaving tanker aircraft behind in history. In the second phase, following on the success of Cube-powered aircraft engines, the Chamber of Commerce plans to develop Cube-powered rockets for near-Earth orbital transport and deep space exploration.

"Hmm, let's see... Unlike us, who solely use Energy Cubes as our power source, the Northern Parliament uses a hybrid system that adds an Energy Cube to traditional power sources. The end result is not as efficient or as clean as a pure E-Cube engine, and it is also harder to maintain. However, the installation process is far simpler and less time-consuming. This greatly reduces the structural hurdles such as having the necessary equipment and technical personnel, and is more compatible with dated fleets. It is possible to modernize an entire fleet in a short period of time."
"Does the goal of modernizing old ships not pose a threat to us?"
"It's hard to say. We're trying to push the limits of combat capabilities through technology, but there are differences in how E-Cubes are applied. Of course, our Enterprise, powered solely through E-Cubes, will undoubtedly be the mightiest carrier in the world after retrofitting is finished. However, should the other side use E-Cube technology to quickly outfit a large number of ships at low cost, their overall combat capabilities will be dramatically enhanced as a whole, regardless of how little each individual unit is enhanced."......]],

A Royal Navy representative concluded the summit with the following statement:

"The arrival of Energy Cubes changed the face of our world forever. With their vast range of applications, we managed to solve all our food and energy problems at the fundamental level.

But, as many people have suspected, not all things these Cubes brought into existence have been good. As a matter of fact, we are on the verge of a crisis of an unprecedented scale. Our enemies have weaponised the Energy Cubes. They have set up countless test facilities to conduct research on the Cubes, and they are trying to use the Cubes' vast range of applications as a weapon to destroy us!

Faced with this regretable fact, what other choice do we have but to move forward with an Energy Cube weapons programme of our own? If our enemy intends to strike us, we must be prepared to strike them back"...]],

…When the first ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■ ■■■■■ appeared, nobody knew about it. But we, the first scientists to lay eyes on the Cubes, knew it even then on some level: Energy Cubes are a black box. We understand what they do, but not how they do it. That isn't to say nobody has done any research – oh no, quite the opposite. Countless hours of research have been sunk into production methods and ways to increase energy efficiency. It is the fundamental workings of the Cubes which anyone has yet to try to explain.

Megacorporations have set up who knows how many research labs dedicated to these blue miracle-makers, but the scope of their research is limited solely to Cubes as an energy source. Their only objective is to create a Cube that's more energy-efficient than the last.

My research, meanwhile, has found evidence that Cubes are so much more than just souped-up batteries. Their use as an energy source is only the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, the many mysteries they hold will take time and effort to unravel.
I wish to prove my theory to the world. In order to do that, I will need additional funding, and your authorization.

The incident began a few days ago. Aircraft carrier Enterprise is slated to undergo extensive maintenance for 36 months at the SD Naval Base, but immediately upon its arrival, the admiral was to leave the base to participate in meetings with the naval leadership.
Initially, our journalists were planning to ask the admiral about the impact of Cube-powered warships on global affairs and what this maintenance would bring to the Enterprise during a normal press conference. However, even though the press conference was in full swing, the admiral was absent without prior notice despite being scheduled to attend! While the press conference itself concluded without further issue, we followed some suspicious leads and conducted our own investigation for a few days. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that the admiral had gone missing!
After entering the Department of Defense building, the admiral seemed to have "disappeared" from the building without a trace, and there were no traces of him leaving. We weren't going to give up, so we contacted the colonel's wife, who unfortunately declined our interview.

...The new weapon, Code G, which looks like a human girl born from a Cube, dropped a bombshell on the scientific community. Almost immediately, researchers across all disciplines began to argue over the fundamental question of its humanity— after all, how should one see an entity such as Code G, artificially born from an object, the Cube?
Naturally, no conference or forum around this "new technology" can avoid this basic proposition. Once this debate begins, however, there seldom seems to be an end to it. ...Currently, there are two predominant mainstream ideas:
The first is widely supported among researchers in academia, including Dr. Anzeel, a well-known Cube researcher: Code G was not born from a generic "Energy Cube," but rather from a special "Wisdom Cube," and because of the various characteristics and actions that "she" represents, she cannot be strictly considered a weapon, but is a "sentient and intelligent being" just like humans. In other words, they are to be considered citizens of their respective nations and as such, have basic human rights.
Meanwhile, high-level government officials and some researchers prefer to define this new weapon as high-performance artificial intelligence. Weapons builts from objects are to be considered as the protected property of the organization they come from, and though they are not programmed, they are still limited by dedicated rules and laws similar to AI, and thus considered "human-created intelligence."
An Eagle Union spokesperson agreed with the latter argument, saying that "[the KAN-SEN] are merely combat weapons with high-performance artificial intelligence and therefore should be treated in the same manner as weapons in accordance to management regulations."

Some proposed solutions call for limiting fleet expansion, hoping that both sides will be willing to walk back their confrontational positions for the sake of humanity and world peace...",

..."Rigging" is a general term used for the equipment worn by the new KAN-SEN weapons, much like the armament broadly used by warships. Similarly, KAN-SEN are classified into destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, etc., according to differences in their rigging.
Rigging is equipped with modules that have the same functions as normal armament, such as naval artillery, torpedoes, and radars. Most of these modules are, as their name implies, miniature versions of real-life weapons, but some seem like they come straight out of science fiction. Rigging cannot be operated by ordinary humans, but are considered indispensable for KAN-SEN. Only when equipped with rigging do KAN-SEN gain power comparable to a warship.
The first rigging, like the KAN-SEN, was believed to have been developed from a Wisdom Cube (likely an evolution of a military-grade E-Cube). However, as research progressed, it became clear that certain modules could be separated from the rigging and interchanged freely, and soon after the first KAN-SEN was built, alternative rigging modules and manufacturing techniques were discovered. Currently, the method of manufacturing rigging is kept confidential by each faction, so a civilian researcher like myself can only speculate, but... I can guess that the Wisdom Cube is still involved in the production of these modules.
Rigging maintenance and modernization play important roles in the upkeep of a KAN-SEN's combat capabilities. Future KAN-SEN technological competition will revolve around the R&D of these equipment modules...]],

...Day 2 of the International Naval Powers Conference has now begun. Government officials from various factions assembled in the Eagle Union to attend this meeting, the largest one of its kind in 10 years, which is also set to last an entire 4 days, the longest in its history.

Following the main meeting on day 1, a press conference was held where an Eagle Union representative announced plans to establish a series of scientific research agreements concerning weapons development using Wisdom Cube technology. In the near future, all allied forces will be able to establish their own fleets consisting of KAN-SEN.

Additionally, the 2nd day of the conference will be mainly centered around the impact this technological breakthrough has on military logistics.
Faced with ever-changing geopolitical developments and the threat of hostile factions, the only way we can keep up is by deepening the bonds with our allied nations and fundamentally reshaping the current structure of our military...]],

...Have you ever come across a weird-looking webpage while surfing the Internet? Maybe your device has accidentally connected to some strange voice channel once?
I'm not talking about adult content, mind you. I'm talking about the secret lines THEY – you know who – use to communicate with each other!

The public doesn't know about these sites, but the fact is they still draw in huge numbers of people. You've visited one of these yourself at some point, haven't you? Yes, you, the person reading this. Whatever these sites say, DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT! It is all propaganda part of their cyberterrorism program!

The people behind these sites are terrorists who've been waging an online war on us for a long time, constantly trying to hijack our signals and infiltrate our networks with the goal of filling them with their propaganda. During their worst attack to date, they seized as much as 40% of ALL our networks!

Fortunately, these cyberterrorists' days are numbered thanks to the precautionary steps taken by our governments. Some of our readers may have already noticed that, as of Friday last week, all of these propaganda sites have been shut down. Trying to connect to them will simply result in an error.
What's more, new security installations have been set up all along the entire border between Europa and the Northern Parliament. These installations serve as both a physical wall and a firewall between them and us! Finally, we can all live without the fear of a hostile invasion, be it online or out on the street...]],

...And now, a news story from the Royal Islands. Since the start of the month, fishermen have reported finding what they described as "strange machines" in their hauls. The size of these machines has ranged from as long as nearly 3 meters, to as short as around 45 centimeters. They outwardly resemble deep-sea fish, with camouflage patterns imprinted on their scale-like exteriors. What's more, these exteriors seem to be made from a material that makes them almost impossible to detect by radar.

Many of the fishermen have claimed that, despite not weighing much and not having particularly thick scales, they are nevertheless extremely durable. One fisherman reportedly struck a machine with a harpoon and was shocked to find the impact hadn't left as much as a scratch on it. The Royal Society has taken charge of these machines for the time being and plans to conduct further analysis on them.

Some civilian scholars speculate that the machines are unmanned reconnaissance drones belonging to hostile forces, believing the larger machines to be central control systems for the smaller machines which do the reconnaissance. As for the reason why they were hauled up in Royal Islands waters, some have theorized they may have malfunctioned and simply drifted there, but nobody knows for certain.

Military experts have weighed in too, pointing out that the machines' distinct appearance is unlike any drone known to exist. They have further cited that the material the machines' exterior are made of, as well as the camouflage patterns painted on them, do not match those of any military drones in active service today...]],

...A large fleet of 400 warships from various factions has already gathered in the NA Area to prepare for tomorrow's navy-military joint exercises.
This is the third navy-military joint exercise to be held this year, and is the largest so far this year.
Unlike in the previous exercises, the new KAN-SEN weapons account for over half of the ships in the fleets present, and as a result, the general fleets, which have long been a major source of military might, have now been relegated to a supporting role to the dazzling KAN-SEN. According to the currently available information, the main purpose of this exercise is to familiarize the fleets with the KAN-SEN and to seek out new tactics.
The exercises are divided into solo exercises for KAN-SEN, joint exercises between general fleets and KAN-SEN, counter exercises between general fleets and KAN-SEN, counter exercises between KAN-SEN, and a final large-scale fleet review.
According to a spokesperson, this exercise is an annual naval review and has no political implications...]],
