Collect the fallen blocks and stack them as high as you can to rack up points.

- How to Play -
· Tap the screen to release the block at the top and try to land it on the tower below.
· If you land the block on the tower, you earn points. If you miss the tower 3 times, the game ends.
· The tower has a balance gauge (seen on the right side of the screen) that needs to be managed. If the manjuu at the center of the gauge reaches either of the red areas, the tower will collapse and end the game.
· When completing the game, you will earn Game Tickets depending on the number of Credits used, as well as your score.
· Refer to the following score-to-ticket values for each Credit spent:
0-5 points: 180 Game Tickets
6-10 points: 200 Game Tickets
11-20 points: 220 Game Tickets
21-30 points: 240 Game Tickets
Over 30 points: 260 Game Tickets
