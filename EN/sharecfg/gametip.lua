About META Showdown:

1. From <color=#92fc63>6/10/21 to 9/8/21</color>, challenge Helena META
to earn Sync Points. Sync Points can be used
to obtain the limited character, <color=#92fc63>Helena META</color> as well
as other great rewards.
 <color=#ff5c5c>Notice: Sync Points will expire after the event period ends.</color>

2. Acquiring and Analyzing META Coordinates
-META Coordinates can be earned by playing Operation Siren.
Sufficient amounts of META Coordinates
can be analyzed to begin an META Showdown.
-You may perform Analysis <color=#92fc63>2 times</color> per day,
resetting every day at midnight. Unused
META Coordinates will be retained.
-You need <color=#92fc63>100</color> META Coordinates to begin 
an META Showdown.

3. Fighting Your Bosses
-Your first time challenging an META boss that you
spawned will not require Oil. From the second
attempt onwards, cost of each attempt will gradually drop from <color=#92fc63>40</color> Oil to <color=#92fc63>1</color> Oil.
(Will not consume a challenge attempt)
-When an META Showdown boss reaches 0 HP,
it will be defeated. Participants will be able to collect
rewards, including a large amount of Sync Points.
-Each META Showdown will only last for <color=#92fc63>24 hours</color>,
after which it will disappear.
Use Request Support if you need help.
-After defeating an META boss, the difficulty
of subsequent META Showdowns will increase by
1 level, up to a maximum of 15.

4. Fight Others’ Bosses
-In the Boss List menu, you can see requests that
other commanders have sent.
When fighting another commander’s boss, you
will immediately gan Sync Points based
upon the <color=#92fc63>amount of DMG</color> you dealt.
-Each attempt uses 1 Challenge Attempt, but
uses no Oil.
-You can have up to <color=#92fc63>3</color> Challenge attempts,
resetting each day at midnight.
Each META Showdown can have up to 30 participants.

5. Combat Instructions
Only ships participating in Operation Siren can
participate in META Showdowns. You also cannot
bring Meowfficers or submarines.
-At the end of battle, no EXP is gained, and Morale
will not be affected.
-You cannot quit during an META Showdown.
If connection is lost due to unstable network
conditions, the following will occur:
a. If challenging a boss you discovered, you will
spend 40 Oil (the first battle is still free), and
any damage done will not count.
b. If challenging someone else's boss,
a challenge attempt will be used, but no rewards
will be granted.
<color=#92fc63>Please make sure your network conditions are stable
before attempting an META Showdown!</color>.

6. Artillery Support
-From the 31st day of this META Showdown season onwards, whenever you begin an META Showdown, your fleet will gain an additional wave of artillery support. This artillery support will deal damage to the enemy and apply a special debuff that inflicts damage over time (this damage cannot be amplified by any bonus effects).
The later in the META Showdown season it is, the greater the damage inflicted by this artillery support.
*Artillery Support will only appear during META Showdown battles you discover, and will trigger with each challenge attempt.]]

Temporary Recruit Info:

About Temporary Recruits:
1. A Temporary Recruit is a ship that joins your fleet for the duration of an event.
2. If you haven't Formally Recruited the ship by the time the event ends, they will leave your fleet. 
3. Any resources you've spent on them through Limit Breaks or Enhancing will not be refunded if this happens.

About Formally Recruiting:
 Once you've accumulated enough Friendship Points (FP) with the Temporary Recruit and collected all the rewards from the event banner, you can upgrade their status to Formally Recruited and they will permanently join your fleet.

Temporary Recruit Restrictions:
1. There are certain restrictions on what you can and can't do with a Temporary Recruit until they've been Formally Recruited.
2. What you can do:
 - Add and remove them from Formations (except for Exercises)
 - Send them into battle
 - Enhance them
 - Limit Break them
3. What you can't do:
 - Retire them
 - Use them as Enhancing Material
 - Use them as Limit Break material
 - Send them on commissions
 - Make an Oath with them
 - Cognitively Awaken them
 - Set them as your Secretary
 - Add them to a Lecture

Supply Line Disruption
1. Supply Line Disruption is available every day of the week.
2. During this Daily Challenge, you'll be able to manually control your Submarines on a special stage and claim rewards by sinking enemy Cargo Ships.
3. This Daily Challenge is available every day of the week, but you can only clear it 2 times per week.
4. Submarines control differently from other vessels. They can't fire Salvos or launch Airstrikes, but instead, they have an ability called Dive.
5. Additionally, they have an Emergency Boost that gives a short speed boost, a Torpedo Attack with limited uses, and an All Out Assault that they can use once.
6. Furthermore, you can tap the icon in the top left corner to change which Submarine you're controlling.
7. Once you clear the stage by sinking the Cargo Ships at the end of it, the points you earned during the Daily Challenge will be tallied
8. You'll also receive Submarine and Anti-Sub gear based on how well you did.
9. Points are given for clearing the stage, sinking enemies, and completing the stage without any of your Submarines sinking.
10. Remember that your Submarines depend on their torpedoes to deal damage, so try to make every shot count.

Tips:
1. Equipping your Submarine correctly will give them more ammunition to use. Both Auxiliary and Main Weapon torpedoes count!
2. Submarine skills don't work during the Daily Challenge, so plan your strategy accordingly.
3. However, they can still use their All Out Assaults once.
4. Surcouf will fire her All Out Assault automatically when she resurfaces, but like all other Submarines, she can only fire it once.
5. All Out Assaults deal increased damage to enemies during this Daily Challenge.
6. You can't change to another Submarine to control immediately after Diving or Resurfacing.

Escort Mission is available on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays.

Advance Mission is available on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.

Fierce Assault is available on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

Tactical Training is available every day of the week.

About Attack/Support Range:
- The Flagship of the Submarine Fleet determines the whole Submarine Fleet's Attack/Support Range (ASR.)

- The Submarine Fleet can move on their own and attack enemies within their range, lowering the enemy's combat strength.

- Tapping the "Submarine Support" button when in combat with an enemy within the Submarine Fleet's range will summon your Submarine Fleet to assist you in battle.

- Submarines will only use Ammunition when attacking enemies on their own. When summoned in a battle, they will both use Ammunition and consume Oil.

- The Submarine Fleet has 2 settings: Support Mode (the fleet will be on standby) and Attack Mode (the fleet will attack enemies automatically.)
- This setting can be changed at any time from the Formation menu on the right side of the screen when sortieing.

Attack/Support Range Level:
- The higher the ASR level the Submarine Fleet's Flagship is, the further from their starting location they can attack or provide support.

- You can increase the ASR level through Limit Breaking your Submarines, leveling certain skills, and equipping them with certain gear.]]

Lecture Hall Information

When you put Students in the Lecture Hall, they can partake in a Lecture which converts the fleet's accumulated Proficiency into EXP.

- About Proficiency
A set amount of the EXP earned by Level 100 or higher ships will be automatically added to the Lecture Hall in the form of Proficiency.
Proficiency is shared among the whole fleet and you cannot accumulate more than the Lecture Hall can hold.
Upgrading the Lecture Hall will increase the cap of how much Proficiency you can accumulate as well as increase the amount of Proficiency earned.

- About Lectures
The types of ships you can send to study in the Lecture Hall depends on the day of the week.
Once you have begun a Lecture, you can end it at any time you wish.
Ending the Lecture will convert Proficiency to EXP for the Students depending on how long the Lecture lasted.
The maximum amount of time a Lecture can last is 12 hours.
Up to the point before the Lecture finishes, the acquired Proficiency will be automatically converted into EXP for the Students in attendance.

- About Students
Only ships below Level 100 can be added the Lecture Hall.
The more Students you add, the more efficient the conversion rate of Proficiency to EXP will be.
Students will lose a small amount of Morale when participating in a Lecture.
Monitors can take Battleship Lectures.
Repair Ships can take Destroyer and Cruiser Lectures.
Munition Ships can take Destroyer and Cruiser Lectures.
Aviation Battleships can take Carrier and Battleship Lectures.

- Lecture Schedule
Monday: Destroyers - Amazon's Amazing Torpedo Tactics!
Tuesday: Cruisers - The Right Ammo for The Right Time
Wednesday: Battleships - Why The "Bigger Gun Principle" Works
Thursday: Carriers - Positioning Out on The Open Ocean
Friday: Destroyers - Tactics Even a Monkey Could Understand!
Saturday: Cruisers - How To Maximize Your Firepower

There are no Lectures on Sundays, but you will earn double the amount of Proficiency from sorties.]]

- Update - (July 8th, 2021)
The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 4 PRs/DRs.

1. New series 4 research projects have been added.

2. If you possess enough Blueprints to fully Enhance (including Fate Simulation) a PR/DR, you will no longer get Catch-Up research projects specific to that ship.
For example, if you only have Monarch fully Fate Simulated (or have enough Blueprints to do so) among all PR1 ships and set your Research Focus to PR1 ships, you will receive projects for all PR1 ships except Monarch.

If you have Research Focus set to a specific PR/DR series and you've fully Enhanced all ships from that series (or have enough Blueprints to do so), you will get research projects for all ships from that series.
Conversely, if you have Research Focus disabled, you will only receive research projects for ships that you've not fully Enhanced (or have enough Blueprints to do so for).

Otherwise, the amount of Blueprints you possess for a given ship does not affect your probability of getting research projects for her.


- Update -
The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 3 PRs/DRs.

1. New series 3 research projects have been added.
Series 3 research projects are marked with the roman numeral "III" in the top right corner of the project.

2. The Research Focus menu has been completely revamped.
Now when you wish to focus on a particular PR/DR series, you can choose between series 1, 2, and 3.
Focusing on a series will increase the likelihood you'll get research projects from the corresponding series, with at least 3 of them guaranteed to be from the chosen series.

Additionally, with the new Catch-Up feature, you can prioritize a ship of a given PR/DR series and receive additional Blueprints for her.
Setting an active Catch-Up ship is done through the Research Focus menu.]]

1. Starting Development:
You can begin development on a PR/DR ship once you meet her development requirements, which are shown at the center of the Shipyard screen when a ship has been selected.
To start developing a ship, select one and tap the Commence button. You can only develop 1 PR/DR ship at a time.

2. Development Tasks:
The ship you've chosen to develop will unlock after you complete all her development tasks.
After starting development, you will immediately gain access to the first task, and each subsequent task will unlock in order at 24-hour intervals.
Some tasks may have prerequisites before you can begin making progress.

3. Changing Your Development Target:
While you cannot develop 2 ships at once, you can switch which one you're developing before you complete all tasks.
Any progress you've made on your current development tasks, as well as the unlocked tasks themselves, will be saved if you choose to switch development targets.
Once you do this, you must wait 24 hours before you can change targets again.

4. Completing Development:
Upon completing all development tasks for a ship, she will join your dock and you unlock the ability to Enhance her.
To begin development on a new PR/DR ship, you must go to the Development Dock and select one. New development targets are not chosen automatically.

5. Enhancing PR/DR Ships:
In contrast to ordinary ships, PR/DR ships require Blueprints to be Enhanced. Blueprints are mainly acquired through conducting research at the Research Academy.
Enhancing a PR/DR ship will raise her stats, unlock new skills, and give her new abilities, similar to ordinary ships.

6. Enhancing with Coins:
Some PR/DR ships can also be Enhanced and undergo Fate Simulation with Coins as a substitute for Blueprints. 
The Coin cost depends on how many times you've used this method of Enhancement previously in a day. The first 15 times each day are discounted.
The following table lists the Coin cost per number of Blueprints substituted:
1 to 2: Free
3 to 4: 90% discount
5 to 7: 80% discount
8 to 9: 60% discount
10 to 15: 30% discount
16 and onward: 0% discount; Blueprint costs 1,500 Coins each.
The game will automatically calculate the Coin cost for you when using this method of Enhancement. The Coin cost resets daily at 4:00 AM.

7. PR/DR Ship Level Caps:
PR/DR ships do not need to be Limit Broken to be able to reach level 100. However, past that, you must still use Cognitive Chips and Coins to further increase their level caps. 

8. Fate Simulation:
Once a PR/DR ship reaches Development Level 30, she can undergo Fate Simulation, etching a historical record of sorts into her hull to be more akin to regular ships.
In gameplay terms, Fate Simulation will allow you to use additional Blueprints to further enhance the capabilities of your PR/DR ship.
Fate Simulation is done in 5 steps. The first 4 steps grant a boost to the ship's Luck stat, and the final 5th step grants an upgrade to one of her skills.
You can also use Coins in place of Blueprints. Please refer to section 6 above for more details.

9. Battle Simulations:
You can preview the performance of certain PR/DRs through the Battle Simulation mode.
To access it, simply select a ship and tap the Battle Simulation button. You will then be sent into a special battle with the ship you selected.

Please note that the ships' stats and loadouts are preset in this mode, and may not accurately reflect their real performance.]]

3. By spending the ship's corresponding <color=#92fc63>PR Blueprints</color>, you'll fill up the progress bar for each stage.
4. Once you've fully filled the bar, you've completed the stage and will unlock the next one.
5. Stages <color=#92fc63>I through IV</color> increase the ship's <color=#92fc63>LCK</color> stat.
6. Stage <color=#92fc63>V</color> improves one of the ship's <color=#92fc63>Skills</color>.]]

About SOS Signals
-SOS Signals are received at random. You can receive them even if not logged in to the game.
-You must first clear the final stage (X-4) of a Chapter before you can receive SOS Signals from that chapter.

About the Search Function
-Tap on the Search button search for the location the SOS Signal came from.
-Once you've located the signal's source, you can initiate a Rescue Mission.
-Rescue Missions correspond to different Chapters, and only one Rescue Mission can be active per chapter.
-Rescue Missions must be cleared within 12 hours, after which they will disappear.

Signal Strength
-Signal Strength affects the range that Rescue Missions can appear in.
-At a Signal Strength of 1, Rescue Missions will only appear in Chapter 3.
-As Signal Strength increases, Rescue Missions will be able to appear in higher and higher Chapters.
-Signal Strength will increase by 1 every time you complete the furthest unlocked Rescue Mission with an S rating.
-The maximum Signal Strength possible is 8. The higher the Signal Strength, the better the potential rewards.

Combat Encounters
-Enemy submarines will appear in Rescue Missions. Use DDs or CLs equipped with ASW equipment to counter them.]]

2. You earn a <color=#92fc63>fixed amount</color> of CP from the first 3 difficulties, but the amount of CP and which rewards you receive on <color=#92fc63>EX difficulty</color> are based on how much damage you dealt during the battle.
3. The Event Stage uses a <color=#92fc63>different fleet composition</color> to regular maps. You can change its formation beforehand.
4. <color=#92fc63>Oil</color> will be consumed when you sortie for and win on the Event Stage. When you complete the map, you receive <color=#92fc63>EXP</color> and <color=#92fc63>clear rewards</color> as per usual, and Morale changes will take effect. (Note that the EX difficulty also imposes a <color=#92fc63>60-second time limit</color>. Your EX difficulty run concludes when you run out of time, when you defeat the boss, or when your Flagship sinks.)
5. You can deploy <color=#92fc63>submarines</color> and <color=#92fc63>Meowfficers</color> on EX difficulty. Calling in your submarines during a battle will cost Oil.
6. You can play on Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty <color=#92fc63>as much as you like</color>, but you will need to spend a <color=#92fc63>Bonus Ticket</color> each time you wish to do a run on <color=#92fc63>EX difficulty</color>.

2. We recommend you play the game on <color=#92fc63>Manual Mode</color> when doing a run on EX difficulty.

You may set this map to <color=#92fc63>Clearing Mode</color> on the operation selection screen after reaching 100% completion..

Enabling Clearing Mode affects a stage in the following ways: 

1 On Normal and Hard Mode stages, enemy escort fleets <color=#92fc63>will not appear</color>.
2 On Event stages, some changes will be made to the configuration of enemy fleets.
3 On event stages, <color=#92fc63>movement restrictions</color> will be lifted,

4 On normal stages, <color=#92fc63>ambushes and airstrikes will no longer occur</color>.
5 <color=#92fc63>Fleet Formation Lock</color> will be enabled.
6 <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> will be enabled.

 <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> Details:
1.  <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> can only be enabled in Clearing Mode, and will be automatically activated the first time you enter a stage in Clearing Mode.
2.When Auto-Search Mode is enabled, <color=#92fc63>Auto Combat</color> and <color=#92fc63>Fleet Lock</color> will automatically be enabled as well. Auto Submarine will not be automatically enabled and depends on your personal settings.
3.After enabling Auto-Search, you may change 4 settings on the fleet selection interface. The settings are as follows:①<color=#92fc63>Escorts Only</color>: This fleet will only engage escort fleets. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to engage the enemy boss fleet.
②<color=#92fc63>Flagship Only</color>: When the enemy flagship fleet spawns, this fleet will automatically move to engage it. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to engage enemy escort fleets.
③<color=#92fc63>All Enemies</color>: This fleet will engage enemy escort fleets until the flagship fleet spawns, then engage the enemy flagship. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to standby.
④<color=#92fc63>Standby</color>: This fleet will not be used to engage enemies. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to engage all enemies.
4. When Auto-Search is enabled, if there is an <color=#92fc63>Elite Enemy</color> present on the battlefield, that fleet will be prioritized. If there is no Elite Enemy present, your fleets will attempt to engage the <color=#92fc63>closest available enemy</color>.

Regarding Airspace Control:
Airspace Control Value (ACV) is a modifier that affects aerial combat. Each stage has its own ACV, which is then compared against your ACV to establish which side has Airspace Control, and to what extent.

Your Airspace Control status affects the following:
1. How much damage your fleets' Airstrikes deal
2. How much damage your fleets take from enemy aircraft
3. The Accuracy, Evasion, and Recon Value of your fleets (to a small degree)

When your ACV is lower than that of the stage's, you will lose control over the airspace, which impacts your fleets negatively.
You can check your Airspace Control status by tapping on its icon, located near the top left side of the screen when in a sortie.

Airspace Control Value Calculation:
The following factors are used to calculate your ACV:
1. The number of plane-carrying ships in your fleets when sortieing (specifically: CVs, CVLs, BBVs, and SSVs)
2. The combined Aviation stat of your fleets
3. The types and number of aircraft your plane-carrying ships have (Fighters, Bombers, Torpedo Bombers, and Seaplanes)
Your current ACV can be found on the sortie screen before entering a stage. If your ACV is lower than the recommended value, you may want to make changes to your fleet formation to increase it.

The following factors determine how high the stage's ACV is:
1. The chapter and subchapter (the later the stage, the higher the ACV will generally be)
2. The combined Anti-Air stat of your fleets
3. For Hard Mode stages: whether or not you have unlocked and enabled Clearing Mode on that particular stage

- General Tips:
1. When one of your ships sink, whatever stats they contributed to your ACV will be ignored, and your ACV will decrease accordingly.
2. Of the 4 types of aircraft, Fighters contribute the most to your ACV. Dive Bombers contribute the second most, followed by Torpedo Bombers, then Seaplanes. If you want to significantly increase your ACV, sortie with CVs that have a lot of Fighters.
3. Even a fleet that is not actively in combat with an enemy node still contributes to your ACV.]]

<color=#92fc63>Tech Mechanics:</color>
1. The Tech Mechanics give stat buffs to your entire fleet.
2. You unlock these buffs by collecting and getting your ships to a high level.
3. <color=#92fc63>The buffs apply to ships which have been fully Limit Broken.</color>
4. In essence, you will gain the most benefits by leveling all the ships you have in your Dock.

The Tech Mechanics can be separated into two distinct types: Fleet Tech and Faction Tech.

Fleet Tech:
1. The Fleet Tech mechanic grants buffs, which are unlocked by leveling your ships, to your entire fleet. 
2. You can view your collection and Tech acquisition statuses on the Fleet Tech screen.
3. The ships are sorted into tiers based on their historical technology development order.
4. When you complete the following achievements with a ship, your entire fleet will receive the corresponding stat buff(s) associated with her group:
 - <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> the ship in your Library - Getting the ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>
5. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive buffs from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them.

<color=#92fc63>Faction Tech</color>:
1. Faction Tech is a mechanic that gives stat buffs to your entire fleet based on your Tech Level with each faction.
2. You can view a faction's Tech Level and the buffs it gives to your fleet by tapping its corresponding tab on the Faction Tech screen.
3. By increasing a faction's Tech Level, you can further increase the buffs that it gives.
4. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you must spend <color=#92fc63>Coins</color> and meet the Tech Point requirement for that faction.
5. Lastly, you can only increase the Tech level of one faction at a time.

About Tech Points:
1. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you need to have collected a certain amount of Tech Points from ships of that faction. 
2. From the Faction Tech screen, you can view how many Tech Points you have with each faction.
3. You can acquire Tech Points through the following means:
- <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> a new ship in your Library- <color=#92fc63>Fully Limit Breaking</color> a ship- Getting a ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>
4. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive Tech Points from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them.]]

<color=#FFDD00>Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019</color>

About the Popularity Poll:
 The Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019 consists of two parts: in-game voting, and website voting. The Poll has 3 main rounds: Qualifiers, Groups, and Finals. 
 For each step of voting, the candidates that advance to the next step are determined by the combined totals of in-game voting across all servers, and website voting.

Popularity Poll Rules:
 Qualifiers round:
 All characters, excluding Hall of Fame characters, that were implemented prior to 8/29/2019 are in the Qualifiers, meaning a total of 298 characters. The top 150 characters with the most votes advance to the Groups round.
 The Qualifiers round will be hosted in-game only.
 Note: during the Qualifiers round, a character's number of votes will not be displayed, only their ranking.
 Qualifiers Comeback round:
 Characters that lost the Qualifiers enter a separate vote. The top 10 characters from this vote get the chance to appear in the Finals Comeback round.
 The Qualifiers Comeback round will be hosted on a special webpage only.
 Groups round:
 Characters that advanced to the Groups round are sorted into 5 groups of 30 ships per group. Each character competes for votes within their own group. The top 3 characters with the most votes within each group advances to the Finals while the top 4 to 10 characters from each group are sent to the Finals Comeback round.
 Finals Comeback round:
 The top 4 to 10 characters of each group and the top 10 from the Qualifiers Comeback will participate in this separate vote. The top 9 characters who receive the most votes will advance to the Finals.
 Finals round:
 The Finals consist of 15 characters from the Groups round and 9 from the Finals Comeback round, for a total of 24 characters.
 Final Result Calculation:
 Once each step has concluded, the website votes will be weighted then added to the in-game votes to calculate the final vote count.
 In the event of a tie, the character who reached that number of votes first will advance.

Final Results Announcement:
 Once each step has concluded, barring the Finals round, the voting results will be announced the next day at 12:00 in-game and on the website.
 Once the Finals round has concluded, the final results will be announced on Twitter and Facebook the following day after server maintenance.

How to Vote:
 In-game Voting:
 Players with a Commander level of 25 and above can obtain Ballots through the following 2 ways:
 1: By completing special missions available during the voting period. These can be viewed from the Missions menu.
 2: By sortieing and defeating Boss nodes in Campaign mode to earn a Certificate of Support.
 Players can use their Certificate of Support on the Campaign overworld screen or the Popularity Poll banner to receive Support Points.
 Support Points will in turn give the player Ballots based on how many Points he/she earned.
 The player can then use their Ballots to vote for their favorite characters with the Vote button on the Popularity Poll banner.
 Please note that once each step of the Poll has concluded, all remaining Ballots will disappear.

About Certificates of Support:
 1. Players can obtain a Certificate of Support by defeating Boss nodes on Campaign (Normal mode only) and Event maps (excluding through War Archives.)
 2. Players cannot possess more than 1 Certificate of Support at a time. It can be used on the Campaign overworld map or from the Popularity Poll banner.
 3. When using their Certificate of Support, players will be sent to a screen with the chibi sprites of several characters. By tapping the chibis in the direction that the Manjuu is pointing, the Certificate of Support will be spent and the player will receive Support Points.
 4. The Certificate of Support will disappear if not used within a certain timespan.
 5. Certificates of Support obtained from higher level Campaign maps give more Support Points.
	Chapter 3: 120 Points
	Chapter 4: 150 Points
	Chapter 5: 180 Points
	Chapter 6: 220 Points
	Chapter 7: 270 Points
	Chapter 8: 350 Points
	Chapter 9: 450 Points
	Chapter 10: 550 Points
	Chapter 11: 700 Points
	Chapter 12: 850 Points

You can check the in-game Help button for more details on the above.

Website Voting:
 Players can vote on their favorite characters once a day by visiting the Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019 website after binding their Twitter or Facebook account to it.
 Players can vote a second time by using the Share button to post their character choices on Twitter. Please note that you can only vote a maximum of 2 times a day from the same device.
 The link to the Popularity Poll website will be posted on the official Azur Lane Twitter and Facebook accounts.

Display Carrier Detection line

About Carrier Detection:The carriers in your Main Fleet can be in one of two states: Hidden, and Detected.

Your carriers start the battle in the Hidden state, but once their Detection Gauge fills up, they will enter and remain in the Detected state until the gauge falls back down below a certain threshold.

While Hidden, your carriers will not be targeted by most enemy skills and attacks.

Additionally, your carriers will also deal increased damage.

1. About the Detection Gauge:

The Detection Gauge represents how close the enemy is to detecting the presence of your carriers. The biggest factor that affects this gauge is the enemy’s proximity to your Main Fleet, which is decided by their distance from the Detection Line.

However, other factors affect this gauge as well. The Detection Gauge increases:

- When an enemy crosses the Detection Line

- When an enemy ship or aircraft reaches the left-hand side of the screen

- When a friendly carrier launches an Airstrike

- When the skills of certain friendly carriers activate

- When a friendly carrier catches fire (when this happens, the Detection Gauge will not go below a certain threshold until the fire is put out)

The Detection Gauge will decrease as long as there are no enemies past the Detection Line.

Each carrier has a separate Detection Gauge, and the higher their AVI stat, the longer it will take for them to be Detected.

2. The Detection Gauge During Exercises:

The Detection Gauge will not decrease in Exercise Battles. Additionally, once the opponent’s fleet gets near enough to your Main Fleet, all of your carriers will enter the Detected state.]]

2. Tapping the bell rope when you have Shrine Visits will consume 5 coins and grant a blessing.

There are several types of blessings with several different effects:

Education: Reduces the time it takes to train in the Tactical Academy.

Career: Our fleet gets a damage bonus in main story, hard mode, and battle record sorties.

Romance: Your secretary ship gains affection faster.

Blessings remain in effect for one day.

3. An education blessing will not reduce the training time of any lesson in progress when the blessing is activated.

The expiration of the education blessing will not cause any lesson in progress to lengthen.

4. Should you pray for a new blessing when a blessing is already in effect, the new blessing will override the existing one, and its duration will reset.

- Catch-Up Info:

The Catch-Up feature gives you bonus PR/DR Blueprints upon completion of a research project.
First, choose a PR/DR ship you'd like to focus on, then simply complete research projects as normal.
You can only receive these Blueprints for 1 ship at a time, but you can switch Catch-Up targets whenever you'd like.

There is a limit on how many Blueprints you can receive through the Catch-Up feature. In the case of series 2 PRs/DRs, the totals are as follows:
- PR ships: a maximum of 300 Blueprints between 4 ships.- DR ships: a maximum of 150 Blueprints per ship, for 2 different ships.

In the case of events which grant Blueprints, these are counted separately from the Catch-Up feature.]]

- Submarine Scan Info:
When an enemy submarine comes within range of ASW-capable Vanguard Fleet ships (DDs and CLs,) they will automatically be detected, thus rendering them open to attack.
Damage can be dealt to a detected submarine using ASW weaponry such as depth charges. However, if the enemy submarine leaves your Vanguard Fleet's scan range, they will return to being undetected after some time has passed.

- How your Scan Range is Calculated:
The following 4 factors affect the size of your Vanguard Fleet's Submarine Scan Range:
1. The greatest base ASW stat among the DDs and CLs in your Vanguard Fleet.
2. The combined ASW stat of all ships in your Main Fleet.
3. The additional range granted by equipping a sonar on your ships.
4. Certain miscellaneous map-specific buffs/debuffs, the stats and skills of enemy ships, etc.

Important note: any bonus points to the ASW stat gained from gear, skills, Meowfficers, or Fleet Tech does NOT affect your Scan Range.

Overview
-In the "Cake Defender" minigame, you must protect the cake from being eaten by Manjuus and Meowfficers for a period of time.
-The game will end when the time runs out, or when the cake has been eaten three times.
-If you complete this minigame while having minigame attempts available, one attempt will be consumed to give progress towards your Early Summer Invitation 2021.

How to Play
・-When the game starts, Manjuus and Meowfficers will make their way towards the cake in the middle of the game screen.
-If a Manjuu or Meowfficer is allowed to reach the cake, they will eat the cake.
・-By tapping on a Manjuu or Meowfficer, a Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII will appear to whack it with her Kitty Kabam Hammer, protecting the cake.
　-The number of taps required to defeat each enemy depends on its type. The more difficult the enemy, the more points you will obtain.
　1) Phantom Thief Manjuu: 1 tap, 100 points.
　2) Ninjuu: 2 taps, 150 points.
　3) Kyoujuu: 3 taps, 200 points.
　4) Solid Sna-kitty: 1 tap, 150 points.
-You will fill your EX gauge upon defeating a Manjuu or Meowfficer. When your EX gauge is full, tap it to increase the attack power and range of your Bulin MKIII.

Regarding Minigames and the Early Summer Invitation
-During the event, you will gain 1 minigame play attempt per day, up to a maximum of 7.
-Upon completing the minigame, 1 attempt will be spent to grant rewards, and you will gain 1 day's worth of progress towards the "Early Summer Invitation 2021."
-Upon reaching 7 days of progress, you will be able to claim the "Early Summer Invitation 2021" from its event banner.
-You may check the number of minigame attempts you have from the Manjuuland screen, and your current progress towards the "Early Summer Invitation 2021" from its event banner.
-You may also view your progress by tapping on the "Early Summer Invitation" button in the Manjuuland screen.
-You will not gain progress towards the "Early Summer Invitation 2021" if you do not have any remaining minigame attempts.]]

-Short Summary: 
After you've cleared chapter 4 of the Operation Siren story, the following things will happen at server reset on the <color=#92fc63>1st</color> day of each month:
1. The state of all secured zones will reset. 
2. Your Action Points will reset and your ships will have any installed Adaptive Tuning removed. 
3. Items used exclusively in Operation Siren will be reset, with some of them being converted into Supply Shop Vouchers. 

The following items are available in the Operation Siren store: 
1. Operation Siren Data Logger. Costs <color=#92fc63>5,000 Oil</color>. 
2. A myriad of helpful items and resources. Purchased using Supply Shop Vouchers.

The Operation Siren Data Logger can be used from the Items menu. Doing so will grant you a lot of assorted Operation Siren items and resources and also lifts the movement restrictions between zones. 

-Reset Prerequisite:
After you have cleared chapter 4 of the Operation Siren story, the entire Operation Siren map will return to its original state on the <color=#92fc63>1st</color> of each month at server reset time. 
Once the reset occurs, you will be redirected to the main Operation Siren menu.
 Any fleets deployed at this time will be returned to Liverpool.

 -Things Affected by the Reset:
 1: All Zones 
When the OPS reset occurs, all zones you've secured will reset. After the reset, you can earn Zone Control Rewards from securing a zone once more.You will keep any stars you've earned for a zone, as these do not reset. Exploration bonuses do not reset either.

After the reset, a new item called the Operation Siren Data Logger will be available for purchase in the store. Once you've purchased it, you can use it from the Operation Siren Items menu to instantly unlock all zones and receive all the rewards for securing them. 

Using the Operation Siren Data Logger will award you the following items:
Adaptive Tuning-Offense <color=#92fc63>(90 pcs)</color> 

Adaptive Tuning-Survivability <color=#92fc63>(90 pcs)</color> 

Adaptive Tuning-Tactics <color=#92fc63>(90 pcs)</color>

Emergency Repair Pack<color=#92fc63> (45 pcs)</color>

Action Point Refill (S) <color=#92fc63>(45 pcs) </color>

Operation Supply Coins<color=#92fc63> (84,000 pcs)</color>

Note: The Operation Siren Data Logger will NOT award any random drops that are gained through defeating enemies.

2: All Modifiers to Your Operation Siren Fleets 

All your ships active in Operation Siren will have their HP, status modifiers, and Adaptive Tuning reset to the default.

Your Action Points will also reset, starting you off with <color=#92fc63>200 AP.</color>

- Comf-Forts Info:

1. You can leave your Meowfficers in Comf-Forts to passively grant them EXP over time, much like with shipgirls in the Dormitory.
Once a day, you may perform the following actions once each with Meowfficers assigned in your Comf-Forts:
- Clean
- Play
- Feed
The benefits of whichever action is chosen is then applied to all Meowfficers in all Comf-Forts.
Putting a new Meowfficer in a Comf-Fort which was the target for one of these actions will not let you redo the actions, nor can you do them again if you take a Meowfficer that was the target for one of these actions and put it into a Comf-Fort that went unused.The benefits of the action you chose will then be applied to the Comf-Fort with the Meowfficer assigned, and that action will become unavailable for the rest of the day.
Putting a new Meowfficer in a Comf-Fort which was the target for one of these actions will not let you repeat the action, nor can you do it again if you take a Meowfficer that was the target for one of these actions and put it into a Comf-Fort that went unused.

2. The benefits of these actions are as follows:
- Clean: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts.
- Play: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and you have a chance to receive Cat Box Quick Finishers.
- Feed: Grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and increases the EXP your Meowfficers earn in their Comf-Forts.

Upgrading your Comf-Forts will give you access to additional Comf-Fort slots, Comf-Fort themes, and increase the EXP your Meowfficers earn while in a Comf-Fort.]]
