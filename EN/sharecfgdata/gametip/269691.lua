3. The event Stage has sea mines and enemy escort ships with distinct movement patterns.
 - More on escort ships:
 The escort ships have an Alertness Level. When they have 2 exclamation marks (!!) displaying over them, they will attack U-556.
 Their Alertness Level increases when U-556 has Resurfaced, is within their sonar range, when she attacks an enemy, and when she comes into contact with a sea mine. However, it can also be lowered by Diving and leaving the enemy's sonar range.
 - More on sea mines:
 There are 2 types of sea mines: drifting mines and bottom mines. They detonate when U-556 comes into contact with them while she has Resurfaced and when she has Dived, respectively. Both can be destroyed by using a Torpedo Strike.]]
