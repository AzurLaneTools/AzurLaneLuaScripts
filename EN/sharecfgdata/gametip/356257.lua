<color=#FFDD00>Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019</color>

About the Popularity Poll:
 The Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019 consists of two parts: in-game voting, and website voting. The Poll has 3 main rounds: Qualifiers, Groups, and Finals. 
 For each step of voting, the candidates that advance to the next step are determined by the combined totals of in-game voting across all servers, and website voting.

Popularity Poll Rules:
 Qualifiers round:
 All characters, excluding Hall of Fame characters, that were implemented prior to 8/29/2019 are in the Qualifiers, meaning a total of 298 characters. The top 150 characters with the most votes advance to the Groups round.
 The Qualifiers round will be hosted in-game only.
 Note: during the Qualifiers round, a character's number of votes will not be displayed, only their ranking.
 Qualifiers Comeback round:
 Characters that lost the Qualifiers enter a separate vote. The top 10 characters from this vote get the chance to appear in the Finals Comeback round.
 The Qualifiers Comeback round will be hosted on a special webpage only.
 Groups round:
 Characters that advanced to the Groups round are sorted into 5 groups of 30 ships per group. Each character competes for votes within their own group. The top 3 characters with the most votes within each group advances to the Finals while the top 4 to 10 characters from each group are sent to the Finals Comeback round.
 Finals Comeback round:
 The top 4 to 10 characters of each group and the top 10 from the Qualifiers Comeback will participate in this separate vote. The top 9 characters who receive the most votes will advance to the Finals.
 Finals round:
 The Finals consist of 15 characters from the Groups round and 9 from the Finals Comeback round, for a total of 24 characters.
 Final Result Calculation:
 Once each step has concluded, the website votes will be weighted then added to the in-game votes to calculate the final vote count.
 In the event of a tie, the character who reached that number of votes first will advance.

Final Results Announcement:
 Once each step has concluded, barring the Finals round, the voting results will be announced the next day at 12:00 in-game and on the website.
 Once the Finals round has concluded, the final results will be announced on Twitter and Facebook the following day after server maintenance.

How to Vote:
 In-game Voting:
 Players with a Commander level of 25 and above can obtain Ballots through the following 2 ways:
 1: By completing special missions available during the voting period. These can be viewed from the Missions menu.
 2: By sortieing and defeating Boss nodes in Campaign mode to earn a Certificate of Support.
 Players can use their Certificate of Support on the Campaign overworld screen or the Popularity Poll banner to receive Support Points.
 Support Points will in turn give the player Ballots based on how many Points he/she earned.
 The player can then use their Ballots to vote for their favorite characters with the Vote button on the Popularity Poll banner.
 Please note that once each step of the Poll has concluded, all remaining Ballots will disappear.

About Certificates of Support:
 1. Players can obtain a Certificate of Support by defeating Boss nodes on Campaign (Normal mode only) and Event maps (excluding through War Archives.)
 2. Players cannot possess more than 1 Certificate of Support at a time. It can be used on the Campaign overworld map or from the Popularity Poll banner.
 3. When using their Certificate of Support, players will be sent to a screen with the chibi sprites of several characters. By tapping the chibis in the direction that the Manjuu is pointing, the Certificate of Support will be spent and the player will receive Support Points.
 4. The Certificate of Support will disappear if not used within a certain timespan.
 5. Certificates of Support obtained from higher level Campaign maps give more Support Points.
