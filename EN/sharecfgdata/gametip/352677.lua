You can play the minigame without a Game Ticket
but will not earn any prizes.</color></size>
1. Press “Purchase” to begin the game. The desired food
will appear above the character’s head on the left-hand
side of the screen. After five seconds, the desired food
will disappear, so the player needs to remember it.
Select the three foods desired by the character within
ten seconds.
2. The desired foods must be selected in the order that
they appeared over the character’s head, from left to right.
3. Press the icon corresponding to the food to select it,
and press it again to de-select it.
The order will automatically be submitted after
selecting three food items.
4. If there is time left over, the three selected foods
will enter the assessment panel. Correctly-selected
food will increase the remaining time. You can choose
to continue the game, or retire. Extra time earned and
scoring are as below:
3 correct food chosen: +5 seconds, +5 points
2 correct food chosen: +2 seconds, +2 points
1 correct food chosen: +1 second, +1 point
0 correct food chosen: +0 seconds, +0 points
5. If you choose to continue, you will retain your countdown
and points and continue to select the three desired food
items of the character on the left.
6. If you retire or the countdown expires, a Game Ticket
will be consumed and the following prizes awarded:
20 points or more: First-tier prize
12-19 points: Second-tier prize
5-11 points: Third-tier prize
Fewer than 5 points: Booby prize]]
