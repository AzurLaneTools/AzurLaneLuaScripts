Supply Line Disruption
1. Supply Line Disruption is available every day of the week.
2. During this Daily Challenge, you'll be able to manually control your Submarines on a special stage and claim rewards by sinking enemy Cargo Ships.
3. This Daily Challenge is available every day of the week, but you can only clear it 2 times per week.
4. Submarines control differently from other vessels. They can't fire Salvos or launch Airstrikes, but instead, they have an ability called Dive.
5. Additionally, they have an Emergency Boost that gives a short speed boost, a Torpedo Attack with limited uses, and an All Out Assault that they can use once.
6. Furthermore, you can tap the icon in the top left corner to change which Submarine you're controlling.
7. Once you clear the stage by sinking the Cargo Ships at the end of it, the points you earned during the Daily Challenge will be tallied
8. You'll also receive Submarine and Anti-Sub gear based on how well you did.
9. Points are given for clearing the stage, sinking enemies, and completing the stage without any of your Submarines sinking.
10. Remember that your Submarines depend on their torpedoes to deal damage, so try to make every shot count.

Tips:
1. Equipping your Submarine correctly will give them more ammunition to use. Both Auxiliary and Main Weapon torpedoes count!
2. Submarine skills don't work during the Daily Challenge, so plan your strategy accordingly.
3. However, they can still use their All Out Assaults once.
4. Surcouf will fire her All Out Assault automatically when she resurfaces, but like all other Submarines, she can only fire it once.
5. All Out Assaults deal increased damage to enemies during this Daily Challenge.
6. You can't change to another Submarine to control immediately after Diving or Resurfacing.
