About Attack/Support Range:
- The Flagship of the Submarine Fleet determines the whole Submarine Fleet's Attack/Support Range (ASR.)

- The Submarine Fleet can move on their own and attack enemies within their range, lowering the enemy's combat strength.

- Tapping the "Submarine Support" button when in combat with an enemy within the Submarine Fleet's range will summon your Submarine Fleet to assist you in battle.

- Submarines will only use Ammunition when attacking enemies on their own. When summoned in a battle, they will both use Ammunition and consume Oil.

- The Submarine Fleet has 2 settings: Support Mode (the fleet will be on standby) and Attack Mode (the fleet will attack enemies automatically.)
- This setting can be changed at any time from the Formation menu on the right side of the screen when sortieing.

Attack/Support Range Level:
- The higher the ASR level the Submarine Fleet's Flagship is, the further from their starting location they can attack or provide support.

- You can increase the ASR level through Limit Breaking your Submarines, leveling certain skills, and equipping them with certain gear.]]
