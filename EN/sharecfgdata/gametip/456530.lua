1. Guild Tech Facilities:
Guild Tech facilities are jointly managed by the entire Guild and grant a number of benefits to its members.
Members of the Guild can gain access to these benefits by contributing Guild Tokens and Guild Funds.
The facilities themselves are administered by the Guild Leader and Officers, who can choose to upgrade the buildings and make their boosts stronger.

2. Facility Management:
- The requirements to use or upgrade a facility can be found on the Guild Tech screen.
- Facilities must be upgraded by expending Guild Tokens and Guild Funds. If your Contribution Level does not meet a facility's level threshold, the Guild Token and Guild Fund cost will increase.
- If a player leaves their Guild and does not join another, their facility levels will stay at the highest they upgraded to.
- If a player leaves their Guild and joins another, their facility levels will carry over to the new Guild, meaning they do not need to start over from scratch.

Upgrading Facilities:\nTo upgrade a facility, a Guild Leader or an Officer must go to the Guild Tech screen, enable Research Mode, and choose a facility to upgrade.\nOnce a facility has been chosen, members of the Guild must contribute materials until the bar has fully filled up, at which point the facility will level up."

5. Contributing Materials:
To donate items to your Guild, go to the Contributions screen and select the items you wish to give.
Once a facility has been chosen, members of the Guild must contribute materials until the bar has fully filled up, at which point the facility will level up.

The Guild can only change which facility it upgrades once every 24 hours. The default facility upgrade is the Guild Roster Expansion.
The number of progress increments that can be made in one day is determined by the amount of Guild members multiplied by 3. If you exceed this threshold, contributing items will yield no further progress, but you will still gain Guild Tokens.]]
