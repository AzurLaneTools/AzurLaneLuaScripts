- Mini-Event Gallery Info:
The Mini-Event Gallery lets you choose and replay old mini-events.

1. You can only have <color=#92fc63>1</color> mini-event active at a time.
2. Once you choose a mini-event to replay, you must commit to it. You cannot change to another mini-event partway through.
3. If a mini-event rewards you with a skin that you already own, you will instead receive Coins.]]
