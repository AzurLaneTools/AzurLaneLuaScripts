During the event period, you will play on a special stage and face off against Suruga's fleet.
All commanders on the same server will need to work together by gathering CP and <color=#92fc63>lowering the progress gauge to 0%</color> in order to complete the mission.
Once the mission is completed, all players who participated will be rewarded with a gift sent to their Mailbox.
<color=#92fc63>Note that you can still earn CP through the Event Stage even once the progress gauge has hit 0%.</color>
]]
		},
		{
			info = [[
<color=#92fc63>- About Contribution Points:</color>
1. You earn Contribution Points by clearing the Special Stage.
2. The progress gauge is affected by the total number of CP earned by all commanders on your server.
3. Once the progress bar hits <color=#92fc63>0%</color>, the mission is complete. Note that each server's progress bar is independent of the others.
4. You can claim great rewards from the event banner by collecting a lot of CP.

<color=#92fc63>- About the Event Stage:</color>
1. The Event Stage can be played on 4 difficulty modes: <color=#92fc63>Easy</color>, <color=#92fc63>Normal</color>, <color=#92fc63>Hard</color>, and <color=#92fc63>EX</color>.
2. You earn a <color=#92fc63>fixed amount</color> of CP from the first 3 difficulties, but the amount of CP and which rewards you receive on <color=#92fc63>EX difficulty</color> are based on how much damage you dealt during the battle.
3. The Event Stage uses a <color=#92fc63>different fleet composition</color> to regular maps. You can change its formation beforehand.
4. <color=#92fc63>Oil</color> will be consumed when you sortie for and win on the Event Stage. When you complete the map, you receive <color=#92fc63>EXP</color> and <color=#92fc63>clear rewards</color> as per usual, and Morale changes will take effect. (Note that the EX difficulty also imposes a <color=#92fc63>60-second time limit</color>. Your EX difficulty run concludes when you run out of time, when you defeat the boss, or when your Flagship sinks.)
5. You can deploy <color=#92fc63>submarines</color> and <color=#92fc63>Meowfficers</color> on EX difficulty. Calling in your submarines during a battle will cost Oil.
6. You can play on Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty <color=#92fc63>as much as you like</color>, but you will need to spend a <color=#92fc63>Bonus Ticket</color> each time you wish to do a run on <color=#92fc63>EX difficulty</color>.
]]
		},
		{
			info = [[
<color=#92fc63>- About Reward Sorties and Bonus Tickets:</color>
1. Your first <color=#92fc63>15 battles</color> on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulty of each day are treated as <color=#92fc63>Reward Sorties</color>, which will give you better clear rewards than usual.
2. If you've <color=#92fc63>used up</color> your 15 daily Reward Sorties, you can use <color=#92fc63>Bonus Tickets</color> to gain access to more Reward Sorties.
3. <color=#92fc63>Bonus Tickets</color> are also used to gain access to EX difficulty.
4. <color=#92fc63>Bonus Tickets</color> can be acquired through <color=#92fc63>missions</color> available during the event period.
]]

		{
			info = [[
<color=#ff5c5c>- Miscellaneous Info:</color>
1. If you abort an EX difficulty run halfway through, your Bonus Ticket will still be consumed, but you will <color=#ff5c5c>not receive any rewards or CP</color>.
2. We recommend you play the game on <color=#92fc63>Manual Mode</color> when doing a run on EX difficulty.
3. A Reward Sortie will <color=#92fc63>not be deducted from your daily 15</color> if you choose to abort a run halfway through on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulty.
4. We urge you to keep an eye on your ships' Morale and Affinity and to not sortie too much. <color=#92fc63>Please be considerate!</color>
5. The number of clears required for any given server to complete the event will differ based on the combined user data of that server.]]
