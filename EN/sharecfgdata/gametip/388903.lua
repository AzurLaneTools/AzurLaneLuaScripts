- The Manjuu Tower:
The Manjuu Tower is a minigame where your goal is to collect the fallen blocks and stack them as high as you can.
When you finish the game while in possession of a Ticket, 1 Ticket will be deducted and you'll receive a Stamp.
Once you've collected 7 Stamps, you can unlock the Sakura Empire DD through the Spring Festival screen.
You will receive 1 Ticket each day for the duration of the event.

- Minigame Details:
1. Tap on the screen to make blocks fall down from the top of the screen.
2. Make the blocks fall onto the tower to build it and increase your score. Once 3 blocks have fallen and missed the tower, the game ends.
3. The tower has a balance value that must be maintained. If your tower loses too much balance and the Manjuu to the right of the screen reaches the red area, your tower will collapse and the game will end.
4. If you stop the game midway through, you won't lose a Ticket, but you won't receive a Stamp either-
5. You can play the minigame even without a Ticket if you'd so like.]]
