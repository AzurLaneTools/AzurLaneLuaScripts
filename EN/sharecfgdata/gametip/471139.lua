Minigame Instructions:
1. After selecting a jewel, you have up to 7 seconds
to move it. During the 7 seconds, you can drag it up,
down, left, or right an unlimited distance.
2. While moving, the jewel will exchange positions with
any jewels on its path. After 7 seconds or upon letting go
of the jewel, the game will settle the results of that move.
3. If 3 or more jewels of the same color are adjacent
either horizontally or vertically, they will be cleared from
the play board. This will be called 1 “Clear.”
During the event, you will receive 1 Reward Attempt per
day, up to a maximum of 7.
1. Playing the minigame with a Reward Attempt will
consume 1 attempt and grant rewards.
2. You may check your Reward Attempts remaining on
the right-hand side of the Celebration Plaza screen.
3. If you have no Reward Attempts, you will not receive
rewards for playing the minigame.
4. If you exit the minigame for any reason, a Reward
attempt will not be consumed, but you will also not
receive any rewards.]]
