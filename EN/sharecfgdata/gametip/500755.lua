Overview
-In the "Cake Defender" minigame, you must protect the cake from being eaten by Manjuus and Meowfficers for a period of time.
-The game will end when the time runs out, or when the cake has been eaten three times.
-If you complete this minigame while having minigame attempts available, one attempt will be consumed to give progress towards your Early Summer Invitation 2021.

How to Play
・-When the game starts, Manjuus and Meowfficers will make their way towards the cake in the middle of the game screen.
-If a Manjuu or Meowfficer is allowed to reach the cake, they will eat the cake.
・-By tapping on a Manjuu or Meowfficer, a Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII will appear to whack it with her Kitty Kabam Hammer, protecting the cake.
　-The number of taps required to defeat each enemy depends on its type. The more difficult the enemy, the more points you will obtain.
　1) Phantom Thief Manjuu: 1 tap, 100 points.
　2) Ninjuu: 2 taps, 150 points.
　3) Kyoujuu: 3 taps, 200 points.
　4) Solid Sna-kitty: 1 tap, 150 points.
-You will fill your EX gauge upon defeating a Manjuu or Meowfficer. When your EX gauge is full, tap it to increase the attack power and range of your Bulin MKIII.
