<size=31><color=#92fc63>TIPS: 
Tapping the prayer button without any Shrine Visits will still consume coins, but will not grant any blessing.</color></size>

1. Spending tickets to play the fireworks workshop, shooting gallery, or new year's feast minigames will grant Shrine Visits.

2. Tapping the bell rope when you have Shrine Visits will consume 5 coins and grant a blessing.

There are several types of blessings with several different effects:

Education: Reduces the time it takes to train in the Tactical Academy.

Career: Our fleet gets a damage bonus in main story, hard mode, and battle record sorties.

Romance: Your secretary ship gains affection faster.

Blessings remain in effect for one day.

3. An education blessing will not reduce the training time of any lesson in progress when the blessing is activated.

The expiration of the education blessing will not cause any lesson in progress to lengthen.

4. Should you pray for a new blessing when a blessing is already in effect, the new blessing will override the existing one, and its duration will reset.

5. You may only have one active blessing at any one time.]]
