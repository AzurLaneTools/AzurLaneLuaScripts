About META Showdown:

1. From <color=#92fc63>9/9/21 to 12/8/21</color>, challenge Souryuu META
to earn Sync Points. Sync Points can be used
to obtain the limited character, <color=#92fc63>Souryuu META</color> as well
as other great rewards.
 <color=#ff5c5c>Notice: Sync Points will expire after the event period ends.</color>

2. Acquiring and Analyzing META Coordinates
-META Coordinates can be earned by playing Operation Siren.
Sufficient amounts of META Coordinates
can be analyzed to begin an META Showdown.
-You may perform Analysis <color=#92fc63>2 times</color> per day,
resetting every day at midnight. Unused
META Coordinates will be retained.
-You need <color=#92fc63>100</color> META Coordinates to begin 
an META Showdown.

3. Fighting Your Bosses
-Your first time challenging an META boss that you
spawned will not require Oil. From the second
attempt onwards, cost of each attempt will gradually drop from <color=#92fc63>40</color> Oil to <color=#92fc63>1</color> Oil.
(Will not consume a challenge attempt)
-When an META Showdown boss reaches 0 HP,
it will be defeated. Participants will be able to collect
rewards, including a large amount of Sync Points.
-Each META Showdown will only last for <color=#92fc63>24 hours</color>,
after which it will disappear.
Use Request Support if you need help.
-After defeating an META boss, the difficulty
of subsequent META Showdowns will increase by
1 level, up to a maximum of 15.

4. Fight Others’ Bosses
-In the Boss List menu, you can see requests that
other commanders have sent.
When fighting another commander’s boss, you
will immediately gan Sync Points based
upon the <color=#92fc63>amount of DMG</color> you dealt.
-Each attempt uses 1 Challenge Attempt, but
uses no Oil.
-You can have up to <color=#92fc63>3</color> Challenge attempts,
resetting each day at midnight.
Each META Showdown can have up to 30 participants.

5. Combat Instructions
Only ships participating in Operation Siren can
participate in META Showdowns. You also cannot
bring Meowfficers or submarines.
-At the end of battle, no EXP is gained, and Morale
will not be affected.
-You cannot quit during an META Showdown.
If connection is lost due to unstable network
conditions, the following will occur:
a. If challenging a boss you discovered, you will
spend 40 Oil (the first battle is still free), and
any damage done will not count.
b. If challenging someone else's boss,
a challenge attempt will be used, but no rewards
will be granted.
<color=#92fc63>Please make sure your network conditions are stable
before attempting an META Showdown!</color>.

6. Artillery Support
-From the 31st day of this META Showdown season onwards, whenever you begin an META Showdown, your fleet will gain an additional wave of artillery support. This artillery support will deal damage to the enemy and apply a special debuff that inflicts damage over time (this damage cannot be amplified by any bonus effects).
The later in the META Showdown season it is, the greater the damage inflicted by this artillery support.
*Artillery Support will only appear during META Showdown battles you discover, and will trigger with each challenge attempt.]]
