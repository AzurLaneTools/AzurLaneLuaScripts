<size=31><color=#92fc63>Game Tips:
Making an offering with no shrine visit attempts will consume Coins but not grant any buff effects.</color></size>
1. During the event, each time you complete a <color=#92fc63>Manjuu Snowdown</color> match,
you will earn <color=#92fc63>2</color>shrine visit attempts, up to a maximum of <color=#ff5c5c>14</color>.
2. While having shrine visit attempts, you can spend 5 Coins
to make an offering for various buff effects.
Possible wishes and their effects are as follows:
Academic Success: Slightly reduced learning time in the Tactical Class
Career Success: Your fleets deal slightly increased damage in Main Campaign, Hard Mode, and War Archives stages.
Marital Bliss: Increases the rate your secretary ship gains Affection. 
All these buffs last for one day.
3. When obtaining the Academic Success buff, any classes
currently in session will not have their time reduced, nor will
the learning time increase if the buff wears off while a class
is in session.
4. If you make an offering while already having a buff effect,
the newly obtained buff will overwrite your previous one,
and the buff duration will be reset.
5. Only one buff effect can be active at a time.]]
