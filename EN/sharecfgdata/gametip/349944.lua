- Overview -
In the Fireworks Workshop minigame, you'll be able to create your own fireworks.
Choose your favorite powder and fill the firework to the appropriate level. The closer the fill amount is to the appropriate level, the better rewards you will receive.
Afterwards, fireworks made from the Fireworks Workshop minigame will be able to be launched from the event hub.
Fireworks that you launch will be displayed until you navigate away from the event hub screen.
