Regarding "Cosmic Concert"
The Cosmic Concert is a rhythm mini-game
where you can earn Performance Notes.
When you get a B or higher rating in a Cosmic Concert,
you will use up a reward attempt and earn
a Performance Note. Collect 7 to get the limited
SR ship, "Le Malin Âµ."
You can earn one Performance Note per day after
the event starts, up to 7 total.
How to Play:
-Select a song from the song selection slider,
and select a desired difficulty level.
In this rhythm mini-game, you will earn points for
tapping an icon when it arrives at the center of the screen. In HARD difficulty,
tap the left side of the screen when a red icon
reaches the center of the screen, and tap the right
side of the screen for a blue icon.
If an icon is followed by a white trail, you will need
to instead tap and hold the corresponding button.
-The "X1" button on the top-right hand side of the screen
indicates the current note speed.
Tap the button to toggle your note speed.
-The rating and score you receive for each tapped note
corresponds to your timing. Your COMBO
will only increase for taps that score a
GOOD or PERFECT rating.]]
