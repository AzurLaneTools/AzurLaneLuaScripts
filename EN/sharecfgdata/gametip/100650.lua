			info = "2. In this game mode, you'll play on a map where your goal is to neutralize the sea mines and enemy fleets in your way and escort the Transport Ship to its destination."
		},
		{
			info = "3. You can run Maritime Escort once a day. Your daily attempt will be spent once you start the run. There are 3 difficulties available: Easy, Normal, and Hard."
		},
		{
			info = "4. Each time your fleet moves on the map, the Transport Ship will move 1 tile towards its destination."
		},
		{
			info = "5. If an enemy fleet engages the Transport Ship, it will take a hit and come to a stop. Until you intervene and defeat the enemy fleet, the Transport Ship will take a hit again after each turn your fleet makes."
		},
		{
			info = "6. If the Transport Ship comes in contact with a sea mine, it will take 2 hits. If your fleet comes in contact with a sea mine, all ships in the fleet will lose a bit of HP. This can be avoided if your fleet has a destroyer, in which case it will neutralize the mine and the fleet won't take damage."
		},
		{
			info = "7. What rewards you receive at the end of the run will depend on how many hits the Transport Ship took. The fewer hits it took, the better the rewards."
