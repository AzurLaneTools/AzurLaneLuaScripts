About SOS Signals
-SOS Signals are received at random. You can receive them even if not logged in to the game.
-You must first clear the final stage (X-4) of a Chapter before you can receive SOS Signals from that chapter.

About the Search Function
-Tap on the Search button search for the location the SOS Signal came from.
-Once you've located the signal's source, you can initiate a Rescue Mission.
-Rescue Missions correspond to different Chapters, and only one Rescue Mission can be active per chapter.
-Rescue Missions must be cleared within 12 hours, after which they will disappear.

Signal Strength
-Signal Strength affects the range that Rescue Missions can appear in.
-At a Signal Strength of 1, Rescue Missions will only appear in Chapter 3.
-As Signal Strength increases, Rescue Missions will be able to appear in higher and higher Chapters.
-Signal Strength will increase by 1 every time you complete the furthest unlocked Rescue Mission with an S rating.
-The maximum Signal Strength possible is 8. The higher the Signal Strength, the better the potential rewards.

Combat Encounters
-Enemy submarines will appear in Rescue Missions. Use DDs or CLs equipped with ASW equipment to counter them.]]
