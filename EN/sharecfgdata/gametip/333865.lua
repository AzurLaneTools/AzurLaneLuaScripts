- Challenge Mode is a new feature, available for a limited time only, for high-level commanders (Level 80+) to prove their mettle.
- In this mode, you'll assemble the best fleet possible and clear as many Challenge Stages as you can, earning you a personal high score.
- If you get a good high score during the period this feature is available, you'll be rewarded with a special Portrait to decorate your player profile with.
- The Challenge Stage lineup will be restructured randomly every Monday at 00:00 throughout the period this feature is available.

			info = "How To Play:"
		},
		{
			info = "1. Put together a fleet from the Challenge Mode screen and start the Challenge run once you're ready. The fleet you create is specifically for this mode and unaffected by changes on the Formation screen, similar to Hard Mode fleets."
		},
		{
			info = "2. The damage your fleet takes during one Challenge battle transfers into the next. You can cancel the Challenge run to reset your progress and fully repair your fleet."
		},
		{
			info = "3. While it doesn't cost any Oil to do Challenge runs, you also will not earn any ship Affinity, victories, or ship/commander/meowfficer EXP."
		},
		{
			info = "4. The score you earn from clearing a Challenge Stage is dependent on how much time the battle took and how much damage your fleet took. You will also earn a score bonus for consecutively clearing Stages."
		},
		{
			info = "5. Once you obtain a good high score, you will be able to claim your reward from the bottom left corner of the Challenge Mode screen. Note that getting a new high score does not make you eligible for the same reward twice."
		},
		{
			info = "6. The Challenge Stage lineup will be shuffled randomly every Monday at 00:00 throughout the period this feature is available, but this will not affect your high score."
		},
		{
			info = "7. If you are able to clear all the Challenge Mode stages, you will unlock the even tougher Endless Mode. You can also try Endless Mode as many times as you like, but your high score is unaffected by runs in this mode."
		},
		{
			info = "Additional Notes:"
		},
		{
			info = "1. You can call in your Submarines once per battle during Challenge runs. Like the rest of your fleet, the damage they take transfers between battles."
		},
		{
			info = "2. You cannot change your formation during a Challenge run, nor can you use an Elite Management Team to repair."
		},
		{
			info = "3. You can end a Challenge run at any time. When ended, your Stage progress will be reset and your total score from the previous Stage will be used to calculate your final score. This will happen whether your Challenge run was ended on purpose or due to an accident or mishap (e.g. you lost connection to the game's servers.)"
		},
		{
			info = "4. Please be aware that if you are in the midst of a Challenge run during a lineup reset (Monday at 00:00) then your run will automatically end, your Stage progress will reset even if you ended the run, and your high score will be unaffected."
