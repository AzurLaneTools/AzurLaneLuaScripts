1. Starting Development:
You can begin development on a blueprint ship once you meet her development requirements, which are shown at the center of the Shipyard screen when a ship has been selected.
To start developing a ship, select one and tap the Commence button. You can only develop 1 blueprint ship at a time.

2. Development Tasks:
The ship you've chosen to develop will unlock after you complete all her development tasks.
After starting development, you will immediately gain access to the first task, and each subsequent task will unlock in order at 24-hour intervals.
Some tasks may have prerequisites before you can begin making progress.

3. Changing Your Development Target:
While you cannot develop 2 ships at once, you can switch which one you're developing before you complete all tasks.
Any progress you've made on your current development tasks, as well as the unlocked tasks themselves, will be saved if you choose to switch development targets.
Once you do this, you must wait 24 hours before you can change targets again.

4. Completing Development:
Upon completing all development tasks for a ship, she will join your dock and you unlock the ability to Enhance her.
To begin development on a new blueprint ship, you must go to the Development Dock and select one. New development targets are not chosen automatically.

5. Enhancing blueprint Ships:
In contrast to ordinary ships, blueprint ships require Blueprints to be Enhanced. Blueprints are mainly acquired through conducting research at the Research Academy.
Enhancing a blueprint ship will raise her stats, unlock new skills, and give her new abilities, similar to ordinary ships.

6. Enhancing with Coins:
Some blueprint ships can also be Enhanced and undergo Fate Simulation with Coins as a substitute for Blueprints. 
The Coin cost depends on how many times you've used this method of Enhancement previously in a day. The first 15 times each day are discounted.
The following table lists the Coin cost per number of Blueprints substituted:
1 to 2: Free
3 to 4: 90% discount
5 to 7: 80% discount
8 to 9: 60% discount
10 to 15: 30% discount
16 and onward: 0% discount; Blueprint costs 1,500 Coins each.
The game will automatically calculate the Coin cost for you when using this method of Enhancement. The Coin cost resets daily at 4:00 AM.

7. blueprint Ship Level Caps:
blueprint ships do not need to be Limit Broken to be able to reach level 100. However, past that, you must still use Cognitive Chips and Coins to further increase their level caps. 

8. Fate Simulation:
Once a blueprint ship reaches Development Level 30, she can undergo Fate Simulation, etching a historical record of sorts into her hull to be more akin to regular ships.
In gameplay terms, Fate Simulation will allow you to use additional Blueprints to further enhance the capabilities of your blueprint ship.
Fate Simulation is done in 5 steps. The first 4 steps grant a boost to the ship's Luck stat, and the final 5th step grants an upgrade to one of her skills.
You can also use Coins in place of Blueprints. Please refer to section 6 above for more details.

9. Battle Simulations:
You can preview the performance of certain blueprints through the Battle Simulation mode.
To access it, simply select a ship and tap the Battle Simulation button. You will then be sent into a special battle with the ship you selected.

Please note that the ships' stats and loadouts are preset in this mode, and may not accurately reflect their real performance.]]
