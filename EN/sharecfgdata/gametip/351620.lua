<size=31><color=#92fc63>TIPS:
Making a Donation when you have no Visits will still consume resources but grant no blessing effects.</color></size>
1. Earn Shrine Visits by using Game Tickets to play any of the three minigames.
2. As long as you have Shrine Visits, you can make a Donation of 5 coins to choose one of these blessings: Academic Achievement: reduces training time in the Tactical Class. Career Success: Deal more damage while sortieing in a Campaign, Hard Mode, or War Archives map.Blissful Courtship: Your secretary gains affection faster.These blessings last for one day.
3. Gaining the Academic Achievement blessing will not reduce the time of any in-progress training.When the blessing expires, it will also not increase the time of any in-progress training.
4. If you acquire a new blessing while one is already in effect, the new blessing will replace the existing one and reset the duration.
5. Only one blessing may be active at a time.]]
