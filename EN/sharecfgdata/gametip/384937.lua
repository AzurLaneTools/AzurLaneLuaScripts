- Summary:
During this event, you can enjoy a handful of minigames and earn Stamps, which can be exchanged for Kinu's skin - "New Year's Blade Demon."

To receive a Stamp, you first need to have a Ticket, which you can get every day by logging in during the event period.

- How to Get Stamps and Tickets You will recieve 1 Ticket a day when you login during the event period.

If you don't login for several days during the event period, you will receive all the Tickets you would have gotten up to that point at the next point you login.

- About the Minigame By tapping the New Year Challenge button, you'll be taken to another screen where you can play Kinu's New Year Training.

When you clear this minigame while in possession of a Ticket, you'll receive 1 Stamp as well as 2 Prayers at the Shrine.

Once you've collected 7 Stamps, you can tap the Check In button on the right to exchange them for Kinu's skin.

Once you've made 7 Prayers at the Shrine, you can claim the New Year's Invitation (2019) from the corresponding event banner.

Note: While you can still play the minigame without a Ticket, you will not receive any rewards from it if you do so.
You may also quit the minigame at any time without losing a Ticket, but you will not receive rewards from it either.]]
