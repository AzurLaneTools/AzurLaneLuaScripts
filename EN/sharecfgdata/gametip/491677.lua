Minigame Rules:
1. Tap "Order" to begin the game. The three types of
foods you want will appear above the
character to the left. After thinking for 5 seconds,
the food icons above the characterâ€™s head disappear.
The player will need to select the right foods from a selection of
9 foods from memory, with a time limit of 10 seconds.
2. The food must be selected in the correct order, from left to right.
3. Tap the food item to make a selection. Tap it again to cancel
the selection. Results will automatically be submitted
after selecting three food items.
4. If time has not run out, choosing three food items
will enter the results screen. Selecting the right foods will
increase your score and the remaining time.
The rules for scoring and gaining more time are as follows:
3 correct foods selected: +5s time, +5 pts.
2 correct foods selected: +2s time, +2 pts.
1 correct food selected: +1s time, +1 pt.
No correct food selected: +0s, 0 points.
5. If you choose to continue the game, you will keep your
remaining time and score, and continue to select food for the
next character that appears on-screen.
6. The game ends if you run out of time or quit the game manually.]]
