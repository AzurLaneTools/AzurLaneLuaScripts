- Catch-Up Info:

The Catch-Up feature gives you bonus PR/DR Blueprints upon completion of a research project.
First, choose a PR/DR ship you'd like to focus on, then simply complete research projects as normal.
You can only receive these Blueprints for 1 ship at a time, but you can switch Catch-Up targets whenever you'd like.

There is a limit on how many Blueprints you can receive through the Catch-Up feature. In the case of series 2 PRs/DRs, the totals are as follows:
- PR ships: a maximum of 300 Blueprints between 4 ships.- DR ships: a maximum of 150 Blueprints per ship, for 2 different ships.

In the case of events which grant Blueprints, these are counted separately from the Catch-Up feature.]]
