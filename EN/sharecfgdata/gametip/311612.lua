Regarding Airspace Control:
Airspace Control Value (ACV) is a modifier that affects aerial combat. Each stage has its own ACV, which is then compared against your ACV to establish which side has Airspace Control, and to what extent.

Your Airspace Control status affects the following:
1. How much damage your fleets' Airstrikes deal
2. How much damage your fleets take from enemy aircraft
3. The Accuracy, Evasion, and Recon Value of your fleets (to a small degree)

When your ACV is lower than that of the stage's, you will lose control over the airspace, which impacts your fleets negatively.
You can check your Airspace Control status by tapping on its icon, located near the top left side of the screen when in a sortie.

Airspace Control Value Calculation:
The following factors are used to calculate your ACV:
1. The number of plane-carrying ships in your fleets when sortieing (specifically: CVs, CVLs, BBVs, and SSVs)
2. The combined Aviation stat of your fleets
3. The types and number of aircraft your plane-carrying ships have (Fighters, Bombers, Torpedo Bombers, and Seaplanes)
Your current ACV can be found on the sortie screen before entering a stage. If your ACV is lower than the recommended value, you may want to make changes to your fleet formation to increase it.

The following factors determine how high the stage's ACV is:
1. The chapter and subchapter (the later the stage, the higher the ACV will generally be)
2. The combined Anti-Air stat of your fleets
3. For Hard Mode stages: whether or not you have unlocked and enabled Clearing Mode on that particular stage

- General Tips:
1. When one of your ships sink, whatever stats they contributed to your ACV will be ignored, and your ACV will decrease accordingly.
2. Of the 4 types of aircraft, Fighters contribute the most to your ACV. Dive Bombers contribute the second most, followed by Torpedo Bombers, then Seaplanes. If you want to significantly increase your ACV, sortie with CVs that have a lot of Fighters.
3. Even a fleet that is not actively in combat with an enemy node still contributes to your ACV.]]
