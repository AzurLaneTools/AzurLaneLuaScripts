Lecture Hall Information

When you put Students in the Lecture Hall, they can partake in a Lecture which converts the fleet's accumulated Proficiency into EXP.

- About Proficiency
A set amount of the EXP earned by Level 100 or higher ships will be automatically added to the Lecture Hall in the form of Proficiency.
Proficiency is shared among the whole fleet and you cannot accumulate more than the Lecture Hall can hold.
Upgrading the Lecture Hall will increase the cap of how much Proficiency you can accumulate as well as increase the amount of Proficiency earned.

- About Lectures
The types of ships you can send to study in the Lecture Hall depends on the day of the week.
Once you have begun a Lecture, you can end it at any time you wish.
Ending the Lecture will convert Proficiency to EXP for the Students depending on how long the Lecture lasted.
The maximum amount of time a Lecture can last is 12 hours.
Up to the point before the Lecture finishes, the acquired Proficiency will be automatically converted into EXP for the Students in attendance.

- About Students
Only ships below Level 100 can be added the Lecture Hall.
The more Students you add, the more efficient the conversion rate of Proficiency to EXP will be.
Students will lose a small amount of Morale when participating in a Lecture.
Monitors can take Battleship Lectures.
Repair Ships can take Destroyer and Cruiser Lectures.
Munition Ships can take Destroyer and Cruiser Lectures.
Aviation Battleships can take Carrier and Battleship Lectures.
