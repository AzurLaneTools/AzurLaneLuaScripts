- Rehearsal Info:
Complete event missions and clear event stages to earn <color=#92fc63>Universe Badges</color>, which can be used to initiate rehearsals.
Check back regularly to see if you've collected enough for another rehearsal.

There are 3 types of rehearsal, each granting a different bonus.
Additionally, your rehearsal level for a given category increases as you perform it again. Maxing out your rehearsal level will award you an additional bonus at the end.

The 3 rehearsal types are as follows:
1. Vocal Appeal - Increases the DMG your ships deal in battle.
2. Glamorous Steps - Decreases the DMG your ships take in battle.
3. Memorable Performance - Increases the EXP your ships gain in battle.

If you're not sure what your current rehearsal level is, you can check it from the right-hand side of the event banner.]]
