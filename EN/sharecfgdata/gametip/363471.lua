1. The EX stage is challenging. You may press the
“Practice” button to try it.
2. Practice mode does not consume Oil, change ship 
Morale, consume “Bonus Ticket,” count towards the 
number of event sorties, or grant Contribution points.
3. If you disconnect or quit while playing an EX stage, a 
 “Bonus Ticket” will be consumed and you will not 
receive any rewards. Please make sure your connection
is stable before attempting an EX stage.
4. “Bonus Tickets” can be exchanged for additional 
“Reward Sorties” on any of the other three difficulties.
 5. The Contribution points earned on the EX stage 
depends on the amount of damage dealt to the boss.
