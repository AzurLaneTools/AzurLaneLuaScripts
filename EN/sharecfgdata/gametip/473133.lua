Minigame Rules:
1. During the event, tap on a grid in the game area to
explore the zone. Each attempt requires exploration
points.
2. Upon reaching 100% exploration in a zone, you
may progress to the next zone.
3. You may only explore grids adjacent to areas you
have already explored. Exploration will further increase
your population.
4. The stage has three types of grids: normal grids,
treasure grids, and combat grids. The rewards for
exploring each type of grid differ.
Notice: Treasure grids must be opened, and enemies
must defeated for treasure and combat grids to count
as explored, respectively.]]
