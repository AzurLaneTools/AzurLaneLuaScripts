You may set this map to <color=#92fc63>Clearing Mode</color> on the operation selection screen after reaching 100% completion..

Enabling Clearing Mode affects a stage in the following ways: 

1 On Normal and Hard Mode stages, enemy escort fleets <color=#92fc63>will not appear</color>.
2 On Event stages, some changes will be made to the configuration of enemy fleets.
3 On event stages, <color=#92fc63>movement restrictions</color> will be lifted,
allowing you to move freely.
4 On normal stages, <color=#92fc63>ambushes and airstrikes will no longer occur</color>.
5 <color=#92fc63>Fleet Formation Lock</color> will be enabled.
6 <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> will be enabled.

 <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> Details:
1.  <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> can only be enabled in Clearing Mode, and will be automatically activated the first time you enter a stage in Clearing Mode.
2.When Auto-Search Mode is enabled, <color=#92fc63>Auto Combat</color> and <color=#92fc63>Fleet Lock</color> will automatically be enabled as well. Auto Submarine will not be automatically enabled and depends on your personal settings.
3.After enabling Auto-Search, you may change 4 settings on the fleet selection interface. The settings are as follows:①<color=#92fc63>Escorts Only</color>: This fleet will only engage escort fleets. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to engage the enemy boss fleet.
②<color=#92fc63>Flagship Only</color>: When the enemy flagship fleet spawns, this fleet will automatically move to engage it. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to engage enemy escort fleets.
③<color=#92fc63>All Enemies</color>: This fleet will engage enemy escort fleets until the flagship fleet spawns, then engage the enemy flagship. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to standby.
④<color=#92fc63>Standby</color>: This fleet will not be used to engage enemies. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to engage all enemies.
4. When Auto-Search is enabled, if there is an <color=#92fc63>Elite Enemy</color> present on the battlefield, that fleet will be prioritized. If there is no Elite Enemy present, your fleets will attempt to engage the <color=#92fc63>closest available enemy</color>. When the enemy flagship fleet appears, your fleets will prioritize attacking the <color=#92fc63>enemy flagship</color>.]]
