- Update - (July 8th, 2021)
The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 4 PRs/DRs.

1. New series 4 research projects have been added.

2. If you possess enough Blueprints to fully Enhance (including Fate Simulation) a PR/DR, you will no longer get Catch-Up research projects specific to that ship.
For example, if you only have Monarch fully Fate Simulated (or have enough Blueprints to do so) among all PR1 ships and set your Research Focus to PR1 ships, you will receive projects for all PR1 ships except Monarch.

If you have Research Focus set to a specific PR/DR series and you've fully Enhanced all ships from that series (or have enough Blueprints to do so), you will get research projects for all ships from that series.
Conversely, if you have Research Focus disabled, you will only receive research projects for ships that you've not fully Enhanced (or have enough Blueprints to do so for).

Otherwise, the amount of Blueprints you possess for a given ship does not affect your probability of getting research projects for her.


- Update -
The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 3 PRs/DRs.

1. New series 3 research projects have been added.
Series 3 research projects are marked with the roman numeral "III" in the top right corner of the project.

2. The Research Focus menu has been completely revamped.
Now when you wish to focus on a particular PR/DR series, you can choose between series 1, 2, and 3.
Focusing on a series will increase the likelihood you'll get research projects from the corresponding series, with at least 3 of them guaranteed to be from the chosen series.

Additionally, with the new Catch-Up feature, you can prioritize a ship of a given PR/DR series and receive additional Blueprints for her.
Setting an active Catch-Up ship is done through the Research Focus menu.]]
