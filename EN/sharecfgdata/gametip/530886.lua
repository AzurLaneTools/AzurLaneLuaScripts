- Comf-Forts Info:

1. You can leave your Meowfficers in Comf-Forts to passively grant them EXP over time, much like with shipgirls in the Dormitory.
Once a day, you may perform the following actions once each with Meowfficers assigned in your Comf-Forts:
- Clean
- Play
- Feed
The benefits of whichever action is chosen is then applied to all Meowfficers in all Comf-Forts.
Putting a new Meowfficer in a Comf-Fort which was the target for one of these actions will not let you redo the actions, nor can you do them again if you take a Meowfficer that was the target for one of these actions and put it into a Comf-Fort that went unused.The benefits of the action you chose will then be applied to the Comf-Fort with the Meowfficer assigned, and that action will become unavailable for the rest of the day.
Putting a new Meowfficer in a Comf-Fort which was the target for one of these actions will not let you repeat the action, nor can you do it again if you take a Meowfficer that was the target for one of these actions and put it into a Comf-Fort that went unused.

2. The benefits of these actions are as follows:
- Clean: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts.
- Play: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and you have a chance to receive Cat Box Quick Finishers.
- Feed: Grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and increases the EXP your Meowfficers earn in their Comf-Forts.

Upgrading your Comf-Forts will give you access to additional Comf-Fort slots, Comf-Fort themes, and increase the EXP your Meowfficers earn while in a Comf-Fort.]]
