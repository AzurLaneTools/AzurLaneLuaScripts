- Event Rules -
1. Until 9/08, 1 new round will open every day at midnight, up to a total of 7. Complete 7 rounds to get rewards including limited furniture.

- How to Play -
1. There are three cups of instant ramen on the game screen, one of which has a fork inside it. The position of the cups will be swapped around. Guess the cup where the fork is to score points and continue to the next round.
2. Your score is determined by the base round score and your remaining time score. The difficulty of the game will gradually increase with subsequent rounds.
3. If you fail to correctly guess the cup ramen where the fork is, time runs out, or you terminate the game, the game is considered complete. If you exit from the game for any other reason, the game won't be considered complete.]]
