- Submarine Scan Info:
When an enemy submarine comes within range of ASW-capable Vanguard Fleet ships (DDs and CLs,) they will automatically be detected, thus rendering them open to attack.
Damage can be dealt to a detected submarine using ASW weaponry such as depth charges. However, if the enemy submarine leaves your Vanguard Fleet's scan range, they will return to being undetected after some time has passed.

- How your Scan Range is Calculated:
The following 4 factors affect the size of your Vanguard Fleet's Submarine Scan Range:
1. The greatest base ASW stat among the DDs and CLs in your Vanguard Fleet.
2. The combined ASW stat of all ships in your Main Fleet.
3. The additional range granted by equipping a sonar on your ships.
4. Certain miscellaneous map-specific buffs/debuffs, the stats and skills of enemy ships, etc.

Important note: any bonus points to the ASW stat gained from gear, skills, Meowfficers, or Fleet Tech does NOT affect your Scan Range.
