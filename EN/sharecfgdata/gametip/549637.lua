- Luck of the Draw Info
Completing special missions during the event period will award you with vouchers which can be used to win prizes from the Luck of the Draw lottery. A new mission will unlock every day up to September 22nd.

Using the vouchers at the Luck of the Draw event page will earn you a random item from the prize pool. Which prize you win is based on the color of the ball that pops out when you spin the lottery wheel. Each prize is limited in quantity; getting all the prizes associated with a given color of ball will remove that reward from subsequent lottery wheel spins.
The following balls and their corresponding amount and prize are as follows:

Gold (1 available) - Special General Blueprint - Series 4 (x2)
Purple (2 available) - High-Efficiency Combat Logistics Plan (x5)
Blue (3 available) - Super Rare Cat Box (x1)
Green (4 available) - T3 Skill Book (x2)
White (4 available) - T4 Sakura Tech Pack (x2)]]
