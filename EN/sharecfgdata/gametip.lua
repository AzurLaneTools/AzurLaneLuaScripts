- Augment Modules Overview - 
Augment Modules are a special type of gear. A shipgirl must be at Max Limit Break to equip them, unless she is a META ship, a blueprint ship (PR/DR) or a ship of UR rarity.
These modules can, among other things, raise your shipgirls' stats, improve certain skills, and clear incoming enemy shells.

Shipgirls can only equip one module each, and some modules may only be equipped by specific shipgirls.
Your modules are stored in a depot separate from your primary Gear Depot.

- Obtaining Augment Modules -
Modules can be obtained through a Daily Raid and crafting.
The Daily Raid can be attempted up to twice per week, and is split into 2 types of missions. One yields Augment Modules, the other yields materials used on Augment Modules.
Modules can be crafted either from the Craft tab on the Depot menu, or through the Augment gear slot on the Dock screen.

Crafting these modules requires Augment Module Cores and Coins. However, doing so will also let you use Augment Module Stones and spare Augment Modules to craft modules with higher starting Upgrade EXP.
You can also craft unique modules for shipgirls who have them. This is done via the crafting menu on the Dock screen for applicable shipgirls.

- Augment Module Attributes -
Module attributes are divided into 3 categories: base stats, conversion attributes, and module effects.

· Base Stats
Base stats are the module's inherent statistics, which vary based on the particular module. These stats can be increased by upgrading and uncapping the module.
Upgrading a module requires Upgrade EXP, which is granted through the use of Augment Module Stones and the recycling of spare Augment Modules.
Uncapping requires Augment Module Cores, Coins, and upgrade materials. Uncapping increases a module's rarity and also resets its Upgrade Level. Currently, modules can only be upgraded from Rare to Elite rarity.

· Conversion Attributes
Conversion attributes are variable stats, determined randomly within a value range specific to a given module.
These attributes can be rerolled through the use of Augment Module Stones. When you reroll a module's attributes, you can choose to either apply the change to overwrite the previous attributes, or cancel the conversion.

· Module Effects
Module effects are special effects that unlock after you've upgraded a given module to a certain level.
Some unique modules also have effects that improve the skills of the particular shipgirl associated with it.

- Augment Module Behavior in Combat -
Some modules have a slash attack as their module effect. This attack is capable of clearing enemy shells and is activated automatically.
The slash attack's pattern and range, as well as the ammo type it is capable of clearing, all depend on the kind of Augment Module equipped as well as the hull type of the shipgirl equipping it and how many have it equipped.

Shipgirls with this type of Augment Module can store up to 1 slash attack.
When she has a slash attack charged, she will perform it automatically either after taking damage, or after 5 seconds pass without her having taken damage.
The slash attack will start recharging after it is performed. All slash attacks require 15 seconds to recharge.]]

- META Showdown Overview -

From <color=#92fc63>6/13/24 to 9/5/24</color>, challenge Wichita META to earn Sync Points. Sync Points can be used to obtain the limited character, <color=#92fc63>Wichita META</color> as well as other great rewards.
<color=#ff5c5c>Note: Sync Points will expire after the event period ends.</color>

- Acquiring and Analyzing META Coordinates -
· META Coordinates can be earned by playing Operation Siren. Sufficient amounts of META Coordinates can be analyzed to begin a META Showdown.
· You may perform Analysis <color=#92fc63>2 times</color> per day, resetting every day at midnight. Unused META Coordinates will be retained.
· You need <color=#92fc63>100</color> META Coordinates to begin a META Showdown.

- Fighting Your Bosses -
· Your first time challenging a META boss that you spawned will not require Oil. From the second attempt onwards, cost of each attempt will gradually drop from <color=#92fc63>40</color> Oil to <color=#92fc63>0</color> Oil. (Will not consume a challenge attempt).
· When a META Showdown boss reaches 0 HP, they will be defeated. Participants will be able to collect rewards, including a large amount of Sync Points.
· Each META Showdown will only last for <color=#92fc63>24 hours</color>, after which it will disappear. Use Request Support if you need help.
· After defeating a META boss, the difficulty of subsequent META Showdowns will increase by 1 level, up to a maximum of 15.

- Fighting Others' Bosses -
· In the Boss List menu, you can see requests that other Commanders have sent. When fighting another Commander's boss, you will immediately gain Sync Points based upon the <color=#92fc63>amount of DMG</color> you dealt.
· Each attempt uses 1 Challenge Attempt, but uses no Oil.
· You can have up to <color=#92fc63>3</color> Challenge attempts, resetting each day at midnight.
Each META Showdown can have up to 30 participants.

- Combat Instructions -
· You cannot bring Meowfficers or submarines.
· At the end of battle, no EXP is gained, and Morale will not be affected.
· You cannot quit during an META Showdown. If connection is lost due to unstable network conditions, the following will occur:
a. If challenging a boss you discovered, you will spend 40 Oil (the first battle is still free), and any damage done will not count.
b. If challenging someone else's boss, a challenge attempt will be used, but no rewards will be granted.
<color=#92fc63>Please make sure your network conditions are stable before attempting an META Showdown!</color>

- Artillery Support -
From the 31st day of this META Showdown season onwards, whenever you begin an META Showdown, your fleet will gain an additional wave of artillery support. This artillery support will deal damage to the enemy and apply a special debuff that inflicts damage over time (this damage cannot be amplified by any bonus effects).
The later in the META Showdown season it is, the greater the damage inflicted by this artillery support.
*Artillery Support will only appear during META Showdown battles you discover, and will trigger with each challenge attempt.]]

Temporary Recruit Info:

About Temporary Recruits:
1. A Temporary Recruit is a ship that joins your fleet for the duration of an event.
2. If you haven't Formally Recruited the ship by the time the event ends, they will leave your fleet. 
3. Any resources you've spent on them through Limit Breaks or Enhancing will not be refunded if this happens.

About Formally Recruiting:
 Once you've accumulated enough Friendship Points (FP) with the Temporary Recruit and collected all the rewards from the event banner, you can upgrade their status to Formally Recruited and they will permanently join your fleet.

Temporary Recruit Restrictions:
1. There are certain restrictions on what you can and can't do with a Temporary Recruit until they've been Formally Recruited.
2. What you can do:
 - Add and remove them from Formations (except for Exercises)
 - Send them into battle
 - Enhance them
 - Limit Break them
3. What you can't do:
 - Retire them
 - Use them as Enhancing Material
 - Use them as Limit Break material
 - Send them on commissions
 - Make an Oath with them
 - Cognitively Awaken them
 - Set them as your Secretary
 - Add them to a Lecture

(Equipment avatars do not take storage space)

Anti-Air Gun Update (December 8th, 2022):

Anti-air guns are now split into two categories: long range and short range.

Short range AA guns can be used by all shipgirls with an AA gun slot, regardless of their hull classification.
These guns fire at any enemy aircraft that enters your fleet's circular AA range.

Long range AA guns can only be equipped by battleships (BBs), battlecruisers (BCs), and aviation battleships (BBVs).
In contrast to short range AA guns, these guns have a forward-facing, cone-shaped range. Much like short range AA guns, they fire automatically at any enemy aircraft that enters their range.
The cone originates from one of the shipgirls with the AA gun equipped, prioritizing your flagship if applicable. Sortieing with multiple shipgirls equipped with long range AA guns increases the power of their AA fire.
Unlike short range AA guns, the shots fired from long range AA guns inflict damage simultaneously to all enemy aircraft within range. ]]

Module Development: this Daily Raid can be attempted twice a week. Your goal is to destroy all enemies.
- The enemies fire <color=#92fc63>special smoke shells</color> which drastically reduce your Main Fleet's ACC and DMG dealt upon scoring a hit.
- Additionally, the enemies perform <color=#92fc63>slash attacks</color> which are capable of clearing some of your cannon fire and torpedoes.

Supply Line Disruption
1. Supply Line Disruption is available every day of the week.
2. During this Daily Challenge, you'll be able to manually control your Submarines on a special stage and claim rewards by sinking enemy Cargo Ships.
3. This Daily Challenge is available every day of the week, but you can only clear it 2 times per week.
4. Submarines control differently from other vessels. They can't fire Salvos or launch Airstrikes, but instead, they have an ability called Dive.
5. Additionally, they have an Emergency Boost that gives a short speed boost, a Torpedo Attack with limited uses, and an All Out Assault that they can use once.
6. Furthermore, you can tap the icon in the top left corner to change which Submarine you're controlling.
7. Once you clear the stage by sinking the Cargo Ships at the end of it, the points you earned during the Daily Challenge will be tallied
8. You'll also receive Submarine and Anti-Sub gear based on how well you did.
9. Points are given for clearing the stage, sinking enemies, and completing the stage without any of your Submarines sinking.
10. Remember that your Submarines depend on their torpedoes to deal damage, so try to make every shot count.

Tips:
1. Equipping your Submarine correctly will give them more ammunition to use. Both Auxiliary and Main Weapon torpedoes count!
2. Submarine skills don't work during the Daily Challenge, so plan your strategy accordingly.
3. However, they can still use their All Out Assaults once.
4. Surcouf will fire her All Out Assault automatically when she resurfaces, but like all other Submarines, she can only fire it once.
5. All Out Assaults deal increased damage to enemies during this Daily Challenge.
6. You can't change to another Submarine to control immediately after Diving or Resurfacing.

Escort Cargo is available on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays.

Maritime Attack is available on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.

Fierce Assault is available on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

Tactical Training is available every day of the week.

<color=#92fc63>Airstrikes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Aviation)</color>.
<color=#92fc63>Main Fleet Salvos</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Shelling)</color>.
<color=#92fc63>Vanguard Torpedoes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Torpedo)</color>.

Completing a Daily Raid stage with an S rating will unlock the quick battle option for that stage.
- Quick battle allows you to challenge that stage multiple times at once.
- Carrying out quick battles will skip the battle and grant you rewards according to the number of battles carried out.
- Quick battles do not consume Oil, but also do not grant Commander or Ship EXP.
- Quick battles will not affect the Morale or Affinity of your ships.
- Quick battle sortie victories will not affect your number of victories or victory rate on your profile page.
- Quick battles count towards the progress of certain missions such as:
  Obtain victory with a B/A/S rating.
  Complete Daily Raids.
  Defeat small/medium/large fleets.
- Quick battles will not count towards the completion of character story missions.]]

About Attack/Support Range:
- The Flagship of the Submarine Fleet determines the whole Submarine Fleet's Attack/Support Range (ASR.)

- The Submarine Fleet can move on their own and attack enemies within their range, lowering the enemy's combat strength.

- Tapping the "Submarine Support" button when in combat with an enemy within the Submarine Fleet's range will summon your Submarine Fleet to assist you in battle.

- Submarines will only use Ammunition when attacking enemies on their own. When summoned in a battle, they will both use Ammunition and consume Oil.

- The Submarine Fleet has 2 settings: Support Mode (the fleet will be on standby) and Attack Mode (the fleet will attack enemies automatically.)
- This setting can be changed at any time from the Formation menu on the right side of the screen when sortieing.

Attack/Support Range Level:
- The higher the ASR level the Submarine Fleet's Flagship is, the further from their starting location they can attack or provide support.

- You can increase the ASR level through Limit Breaking your Submarines, leveling certain skills, and equipping them with certain gear.]]

Lecture Hall Information

In the Lecture Hall, you will be able to convert the Proficiency gained by your fleet into EXP Data Packs (based on your Proficiency to EXP).

- About Proficiency -
A certain proportion of the EXP gained during sorties by ships that are Level 100 and fully Limit Broken will be stored in the Lecture Hall as Proficiency.
Proficiency is shared across the whole fleet and you cannot accumulate more than the Lecture Hall can hold.
Upgrading the Lecture Hall will increase the total amount of Proficiency that you can hold, as well as the rate at which Proficiency is gained.
Additionally, you will earn double the amount of Proficiency on Sundays.

- About EXP Data Pack Production -
The Lecture Hall can produce EXP Data Packs that can be given to ships of your choosing, as long as you have more than 0 Proficiency, and the chosen ship has not reached the EXP cap.
You can collect the EXP Data Packs produced by your Lecture Hall by selecting the "Lecture Hall" button from either the Academy interface or on the sidebar menu on the home screen. When collecting EXP Data Packs, your Lecture Hall's Proficiency will decrease by a corresponding amount.
You can use the EXP Data Packs by tapping the "Boost EXP" button seen above a ship's EXP bar on the Dock menu.
By upgrading the Lecture Hall, you will be able to increase your EXP production rate.]]

The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 6 PRs/DRs.

New series 6 research projects have been added.


- Update -
The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 5 PRs/DRs.

1. New series 5 research projects have been added.

2. A new feature, research queueing, has been added to the Research Academy.
You can now queue up research projects if you meet all their completion requirements. Queued projects will be completed in the order they were added to the queue, and once added, cannot be removed.
Your research queue can hold up to 5 projects at a time. When you add a project to the queue, the list of available research projects will be refreshed.


- Update -
The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 4 PRs/DRs.

1. New series 4 research projects have been added.

2. If you possess enough Blueprints to fully Enhance (including Fate Simulation) a PR/DR, you will no longer get Catch-Up research projects specific to that ship.
For example, if you only have Monarch fully Fate Simulated (or have enough Blueprints to do so) among all PR1 ships and set your Research Focus to PR1 ships, you will receive projects for all PR1 ships except Monarch.

If you have Research Focus set to a specific PR/DR series and you've fully Enhanced all ships from that series (or have enough Blueprints to do so), you will get research projects for all ships from that series.
Conversely, if you have Research Focus disabled, you will only receive research projects for ships that you've not fully Enhanced (or have enough Blueprints to do so for).

Otherwise, the amount of Blueprints you possess for a given ship does not affect your probability of getting research projects for her.


- Update -
The Research Academy has received an update with the addition of series 3 PRs/DRs.

1. New series 3 research projects have been added.
Series 3 research projects are marked with the roman numeral "III" in the top right corner of the project.

2. The Research Focus menu has been completely revamped.  Now when you wish to focus on a particular PR/DR series, you can choose between series 1, 2, and 3.
Focusing on a series will increase the likelihood you'll get research projects from the corresponding series, with at least 3 of them guaranteed to be from the chosen series.

Additionally, with the new Catch-Up feature, you can prioritize a ship of a given PR/DR series and receive additional Blueprints for her.
Setting an active Catch-Up ship is done through the Research Focus menu.]]

1. Starting Development:
You can begin development on a PR/DR ship once you meet her development requirements, which are shown at the center of the Shipyard screen when a ship has been selected.
To start developing a ship, select one and tap the Commence button. You can only develop 1 PR/DR ship at a time.

2. Development Tasks:
The ship you've chosen to develop will unlock after you complete all her development tasks.
After starting development, you will immediately gain access to the first task, and each subsequent task will unlock in order at 24-hour intervals.
Some tasks may have prerequisites before you can begin making progress.

3. Changing Your Development Target:
While you cannot develop 2 ships at once, you can switch which one you're developing before you complete all tasks.
Any progress you've made on your current development tasks, as well as the unlocked tasks themselves, will be saved if you choose to switch development targets.
Once you do this, you must wait 24 hours before you can change targets again.

4. Completing Development:
Upon completing all development tasks for a ship, she will join your dock and you unlock the ability to Enhance her.
To begin development on a new PR/DR ship, you must go to the Development Dock and select one. New development targets are not chosen automatically.

5. Enhancing PR/DR Ships:
In contrast to ordinary ships, PR/DR ships require Blueprints to be Enhanced. Blueprints are mainly acquired through conducting research at the Research Academy.
Enhancing a PR/DR ship will raise her stats, unlock new skills, and give her new abilities, similar to ordinary ships.
6. Enhancing with Coins:
Some PR/DR ships can also be Enhanced and undergo Fate Simulation with Coins as a substitute for Blueprints. 
The Coin cost depends on how many times you've used this method of Enhancement previously in a day, as well as whether the ship is classified as a PR or a DR. The first 15 times each day are discounted.
The following tables list the Coin cost per number of Blueprints substituted:

For a PR ship:
1 to 2: Free
3 to 4: 90% discount
5 to 7: 80% discount
8 to 9: 60% discount
10 to 15: 30% discount
16 and onward: 0% discount; Blueprints cost 1,500 Coins each.

For a DR ship:
1 to 2: Free
3 to 6: 90% discount
7 to 10: 80% discount
11 to 15: 50% discount
16 and onward: 0% discount; Blueprints cost 6,000 Coins each.

The game will automatically calculate the Coin cost for you when using this method of Enhancement. The Coin cost resets daily at 4:00 AM.

7. PR/DR Ship Level Caps:
PR/DR ships do not need to be Limit Broken to be able to reach level 100. However, past that, you must still use Cognitive Chips and Coins to further increase their level caps. 

8. Fate Simulation:
Once a PR/DR ship reaches Development Level 30, she can undergo Fate Simulation, etching a historical record of sorts into her hull to be more akin to regular ships.
In gameplay terms, Fate Simulation will allow you to use additional Blueprints to further enhance the capabilities of your PR/DR ship.
Fate Simulation is done in 5 steps. The first 4 steps grant a boost to the ship's Luck stat, and the final 5th step grants an upgrade to one of her skills.
You can also use Coins in place of Blueprints. Please refer to section 6 above for more details.

9. Battle Simulations:
You can preview the performance of certain PR/DRs through the Battle Simulation mode.
To access it, simply select a ship and tap the Battle Simulation button. You will then be sent into a special battle with the ship you selected.

Please note that the ships' stats and loadouts are preset in this mode, and may not accurately reflect their real performance.]]

3. By spending the ship's corresponding <color=#92fc63>PR Blueprints</color>, you'll fill up the progress bar for each stage.

Upon reaching 100% completion for a given stage, you may choose to enable <color=#92fc63>Clearing Mode</color> for it.

Enabling Clearing Mode affects a stage in the following ways: 

1. A maximum Fuel cost limit is added. If the combined Fuel cost of entering a battle with your surface fleets and submarine fleets would exceed this limit, your Fuel cost is automatically reduced to the limit's maximum. This limit is only active while Clearing Mode is enabled.
2. On Hard Mode stages, enemy escort fleets <color=#92fc63>will not appear</color>.
3. On Event stages, some changes will be made to the configurations of enemy fleets.
4. On event stages, <color=#92fc63>movement restrictions</color> will be lifted, allowing you to move your fleets freely.
5. On normal stages, <color=#92fc63>ambushes and air raids will no longer occur</color>.
6. <color=#92fc63>Fleet Formation Lock</color> will be enabled.
7. <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> will be enabled.

 <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> Details:
1. <color=#92fc63>Auto-Search Mode</color> can only be enabled in Clearing Mode, and will be automatically activated the first time you enter a stage in Clearing Mode.
2.When Auto-Search Mode is enabled, <color=#92fc63>Auto Combat</color> and <color=#92fc63>Fleet Lock</color> will automatically be enabled as well. Auto Submarine will not be automatically enabled and depends on your personal settings.
3.After enabling Auto-Search, you may change 4 settings on the fleet selection interface. The settings are as follows:①<color=#92fc63>Escorts Only</color>: This fleet will only engage escort fleets. When set, the other fleet will automatically be set to engage the enemy boss fleet.

Regarding Airspace Control:
Airspace Control Value (ACV) is a modifier that affects aerial combat. Each stage has its own ACV, which is then compared against your ACV to establish which side has Airspace Control, and to what extent.

Your Airspace Control status affects the following:
1. How much damage your fleets' Airstrikes deal
2. How much damage your fleets take from enemy aircraft
3. The Accuracy, Evasion, and Recon Value of your fleets (to a small degree)

When your ACV is lower than that of the stage's, you will lose control over the airspace, which impacts your fleets negatively.
You can check your Airspace Control status by tapping on its icon, located near the top left side of the screen when in a sortie.

Airspace Control Value Calculation:
The following factors are used to calculate your ACV:
1. The number of plane-carrying ships in your fleets when sortieing (specifically: CVs, CVLs, BBVs, and SSVs)
2. The combined Aviation stat of your fleets
3. The types and number of aircraft your plane-carrying ships have (Fighters, Bombers, Torpedo Bombers, and Seaplanes)
Your current ACV can be found on the sortie screen before entering a stage. If your ACV is lower than the recommended value, you may want to make changes to your fleet formation to increase it.

The following factors determine how high the stage's ACV is:
1. The chapter and subchapter (the later the stage, the higher the ACV will generally be)
2. The combined Anti-Air stat of your fleets
3. For Hard Mode stages: whether or not you have unlocked and enabled Clearing Mode on that particular stage

- General Tips:
1. When one of your ships sink, whatever stats they contributed to your ACV will be ignored, and your ACV will decrease accordingly.
2. Of the 4 types of aircraft, Fighters contribute the most to your ACV. Dive Bombers contribute the second most, followed by Torpedo Bombers, then Seaplanes. If you want to significantly increase your ACV, sortie with CVs that have a lot of Fighters.
3. Even a fleet that is not actively in combat with an enemy node still contributes to your ACV.]]

<color=#92fc63>Tech Mechanics:</color>
1. The Tech Mechanics give stat buffs to your entire fleet.
2. You unlock these buffs by collecting and getting your ships to a high level.
3. <color=#92fc63>The buffs apply to ships which have been fully Limit Broken.</color>
4. In essence, you will gain the most benefits by leveling all the ships you have in your Dock.

The Tech Mechanics can be separated into two distinct types: Fleet Tech and Faction Tech.

Fleet Tech:
1. The Fleet Tech mechanic grants buffs, which are unlocked by leveling your ships, to your entire fleet. 
2. You can view your collection and Tech acquisition statuses on the Fleet Tech screen.
3. The ships are sorted into tiers based on their historical technology development order.
4. When you complete the following achievements with a ship, your entire fleet will receive the corresponding stat buff(s) associated with her group:
 - <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> the ship in your Library - Getting the ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>
5. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive buffs from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them.

<color=#92fc63>Faction Tech</color>:
1. Faction Tech is a mechanic that gives stat buffs to your entire fleet based on your Tech Level with each faction.
2. You can view a faction's Tech Level and the buffs it gives to your fleet by tapping its corresponding tab on the Faction Tech screen.
3. By increasing a faction's Tech Level, you can further increase the buffs that it gives.
4. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you must spend <color=#92fc63>Coins</color> and meet the Tech Point requirement for that faction.
5. Lastly, you can only increase the Tech level of one faction at a time.

About Tech Points:
1. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you need to have collected a certain amount of Tech Points from ships of that faction. 
2. From the Faction Tech screen, you can view how many Tech Points you have with each faction.
3. You can acquire Tech Points through the following means:
- <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> a new ship in your Library- <color=#92fc63>Fully Limit Breaking</color> a ship- Getting a ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>
4. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive Tech Points from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them.]]

Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2021

- About the Popularity Poll:
The Azur Lane Popularity Poll makes its comeback for 2021. During this campaign, commanders can complete ingame tasks to receive votes which they can give to their favorite shipgirls.
The poll will be conducted in 5 rounds: Qualifiers, Qualifier Comeback, Groups, Finals Comeback, and lastly, Finals.

- Popularity Poll Rules:
Votes from commanders across all servers will be pooled together during each round of voting. After the votes are in, the winners will proceed to the next round.
In the event of a tie during the Qualifiers round, the shipgirl who reached that number of votes first will be the one to advance.
In the event of a tie during any round after the Qualifiers, the shipgirl who ranked higher during the Qualifiers round will be the one to advance.

The 3 winners of the previous global server Popularity Poll have entered the popularity Hall of Fame, and are excluded from the voting list.
Collaboration-exclusive characters, META ships, µ ships, and any ships implemented after October 14th, 2021, are also excluded from this list. PR/DR ships are still eligible, assuming they don't also fit into any of the above criteria.

The winners of the previous Popularity Poll (Amagi, Laffey, and Bismarck) have been given a special story snippet each, which can be viewed through the Hall of Fame, located on the Popularity Poll event banner. Commanders can also unlock special commemorative chat frames through this banner.

- Voting Schedule:

1. Qualifiers Round:
Begins after the October 14th maintenance, ends on October 25th, 23:59 server time.
A total of 451 ships will participate in this round of voting. The top 200 shipgirls with the most votes will move on to the Groups round.
The individual shipgirl vote totals will not be shown for this round, only their ranks.

2. Qualifiers Comeback Round:
Begins at midnight server time on October 28th, ends on November 1st, 23:59 server time.
All shipgirls who didn't advance in the previous round will participate in this one. The top 15 shipgirls with the most votes will move on to the Finals Comeback round.
3. Groups Round:
Group A: begins at midnight server time on November 4th, ends on November 8th, 23:59 server time.
Group B: begins at midnight server time on November 11th, ends on November 15th, 23:59 server time.
Group C: begins at midnight server time on November 18th, ends on November 22nd, 23:59 server time.
Group D: begins at midnight server time on November 25th, ends on November 29th, 23:59 server time.
Group E: begins at midnight server time on December 2nd, ends on December 6th, 23:59 server time.
Shipgirls that advanced to the Groups round are sorted into 5 groups of 40 shipgirls per group. The top 4 shipgirls within each group with the most votes will move on to the Finals round, and those with the top 5 to 12 most votes within each group will move on to the Finals Comeback round.

4. Finals Comeback Round:
Begins at midnight server time on December 9th, ends on December 12th, 23:59 server time.
The participants of this round will be the top 15 winners of the Qualifiers Comeback round, and the 40 shipgirls who barely didn't make the cut during the Groups round. The top 12 shipgirls who receive the most votes this round move on to the Finals.

5. Finals Round:
Begins at midnight server time on December 17th, ends on December 23rd, 23:59 server time.
The participants of this round will be the top 12 winners of the Finals Comeback round, and the top 4 winners of each group during the Groups round, for a total of 32 shipgirls who'll compete for the final round of voting.

- Final Results Announcement:

Once each step has concluded, barring the Finals round, the voting results will be announced the next day at 12:00 both in the game client and on the poll website.
Once the Finals round has concluded, the final results will be announced on Twitter and Facebook the following day after server maintenance.

- How to Vote:

All commanders at Commander level 25 and above are eligible to vote with the use of Ballots. Ballots can be obtained the following two ways:

1) By completing special missions available during the voting period. These can be viewed from the Missions menu.
2) By sortieing and defeating Boss fleets in Campaign Chapters 3 and above to earn a Certificate of Support.
Commanders can use their Certificates of Support on the Campaign overworld screen or the Popularity Poll banner to receive Support Points.
Support Points will in turn give the commander Ballots based on how many Points they earned.
Commanders can then use their Ballots to vote for their favorite shipgirls with the Vote button on the Popularity Poll banner.
Be aware that once each step of the Poll has concluded, all unspent Ballots will disappear from your inventory.

- More Info about Certificates of Support:

1. Commanders can obtain a Certificate of Support by defeating Boss nodes on Campaign (Normal mode only) and Event maps (excluding through War Archives.)
2. Commanders can only possess 1 Certificate of Support at a time. It can be used on the Campaign overworld map or from the Popularity Poll banner.
3. When using their Certificate of Support, commanders will be sent to a screen with the chibi sprites of several characters. By tapping the chibis in the direction that the Manjuu is pointing, the Certificate of Support will be spent and the commander will receive Support Points.
4. The Certificate of Support will disappear from your inventory if not used within a certain time.
5. Certificates of Support obtained from higher level Campaign maps give more Support Points. The number of points earned per Chapter is shown in the table below:

Chapter 3: 120 Points
Chapter 4: 150 Points
Chapter 5: 180 Points
Chapter 6: 220 Points
Chapter 7: 270 Points
Chapter 8: 350 Points
Chapter 9: 450 Points
Chapter 10: 550 Points
Chapter 11: 700 Points
Chapter 12: 850 Points
Chapter 13: 1,000 Points
Chapter 14: 1,150 Points.]]

Display Carrier Detection line

About Carrier Detection:The carriers in your Main Fleet can be in one of two states: Hidden, and Detected.

Your carriers start the battle in the Hidden state, but once their Detection Gauge fills up, they will enter and remain in the Detected state until the gauge falls back down below a certain threshold.

While Hidden, your carriers will not be targeted by most enemy skills and attacks.

Additionally, your carriers will also deal increased damage.

1. About the Detection Gauge:

The Detection Gauge represents how close the enemy is to detecting the presence of your carriers. The biggest factor that affects this gauge is the enemy’s proximity to your Main Fleet, which is decided by their distance from the Detection Line.

However, other factors affect this gauge as well. The Detection Gauge increases:

- When an enemy crosses the Detection Line

- When an enemy ship or aircraft reaches the left-hand side of the screen

- When a friendly carrier launches an Airstrike

- When the skills of certain friendly carriers activate

- When a friendly carrier catches fire (when this happens, the Detection Gauge will not go below a certain threshold until the fire is put out)

The Detection Gauge will decrease as long as there are no enemies past the Detection Line.

Each carrier has a separate Detection Gauge, and the higher their AVI stat, the longer it will take for them to be Detected.

2. The Detection Gauge During Exercises:

The Detection Gauge will not decrease in Exercise Battles. Additionally, once the opponent’s fleet gets near enough to your Main Fleet, all of your carriers will enter the Detected state.]]

- Summary:
During this event, you can enjoy a handful of minigames and earn Stamps, which can be exchanged for Kinu's skin - "New Year's Blade Demon."

To receive a Stamp, you first need to have a Ticket, which you can get every day by logging in during the event period.

- How to Get Stamps and Tickets You will recieve 1 Ticket a day when you login during the event period.

If you don't login for several days during the event period, you will receive all the Tickets you would have gotten up to that point at the next point you login.

- About the Minigame By tapping the New Year Challenge button, you'll be taken to another screen where you can play Kinu's New Year Training.

When you clear this minigame while in possession of a Ticket, you'll receive 1 Stamp as well as 2 Prayers at the Shrine.

Once you've collected 7 Stamps, you can tap the Check In button on the right to exchange them for Kinu's skin.

Once you've made 7 Prayers at the Shrine, you can claim the New Year's Invitation (2019) from the corresponding event banner.

Note: While you can still play the minigame without a Ticket, you will not receive any rewards from it if you do so.
You may also quit the minigame at any time without losing a Ticket, but you will not receive rewards from it either.]]

2. Tapping the bell rope when you have Shrine Visits will consume 5 coins and grant a blessing.

There are several types of blessings with several different effects:

Education: Reduces the time it takes to train in the Tactical Academy.

Career: Our fleet gets a damage bonus in main story, hard mode, and battle record sorties.

Romance: Your secretary ship gains affection faster.

Blessings remain in effect for one day.

3. An education blessing will not reduce the training time of any lesson in progress when the blessing is activated.

The expiration of the education blessing will not cause any lesson in progress to lengthen.

4. Should you pray for a new blessing when a blessing is already in effect, the new blessing will override the existing one, and its duration will reset.

- Decryption -
In this minigame, use Intel Pts earned from the "Darkness Within Dawn" event to decrypt pieces of intel and unlock Passcodes to gain corresponding rewards.

- Decryption Screen Details -
You can see your current decryption attempts on the left side of the screen.
By tapping the knobs on the right side of the screen, you can change the displayed intel.
You can decrypt intel by tapping the noise-like squares in the middle of the intel display screen.
You can access Passcodes by tapping the button on the bottom-right.
After completing intel decryption, collect the corresponding rewards from the bottom left side of the screen.

- How to Play -
1. Earn Intel Pts by completing "Darkness Within Dawn" event missions. For every <color=#92fc63>200</color> Intel Pts you earn, you will gain 1 Decryption attempt.
2. Tap on the knobs on the right-hand side of the screen to display the intel being decrypted, and tap on undecrypted parts of the screen (noise-like appearance) to decrypt it, spending 1 Decryption attempt in the process.
3. After all the panels have been decrypted, the intel is considered completely decrypted, and you can change the decryption target by tapping on the knobs on the right-hand side of the screen.
4. When all intel has been decrypted, the Passcodes page at the bottom right-hand side of the screen will be unlocked.
5. Opening the Passcodes page shows you all the Passcodes you've decrypted.
6. The light on the top left side of the screen will glow green when you've entered the right codes in the right order.
7. Once you've correctly input 3 Passcodes, you can claim a reward from the bottom left side of the screen.
8. You'll be able to claim the following rewards in order based on the number of grids you've decrypted:
10 grids: 1,000 Coins
20 grids: 5 T3 Universal Retrofit Materials
30 grids: 1,000 Coins
40 grids: 2 T3 Offensive Skill Books

- Catch-Up Info:

The Catch-Up feature gives you bonus PR/DR Blueprints upon completion of a research project.
First, choose a PR/DR ship you'd like to focus on, then simply complete research projects as normal.
You can only receive these Blueprints for 1 ship at a time, but you can switch Catch-Up targets whenever you'd like.

There is a limit on how many Blueprints you can receive through the Catch-Up feature. In the case of series 2 PRs/DRs, the totals are as follows:
- PR ships: a maximum of 300 Blueprints between 4 ships.- DR ships: a maximum of 150 Blueprints per ship, for 2 different ships.

In the case of events which grant Blueprints, these are counted separately from the Catch-Up feature.]]

When an enemy submarine comes within range of ASW-capable Vanguard Fleet ships (DDs and CLs,) they will automatically be detected, thus rendering them open to attack.
Damage can be dealt to a detected submarine using ASW weaponry such as depth charges. However, if the enemy submarine leaves your Vanguard Fleet's scan range, they will return to being undetected after some time has passed.

- How your Scan Range is Calculated:
The following 4 factors affect the size of your Vanguard Fleet's Submarine Scan Range:
1. The greatest base ASW stat among the DDs and CLs in your Vanguard Fleet.
2. The combined ASW stat of all ships in your Main Fleet.
3. The additional range granted by equipping a sonar on your ships.
4. Certain miscellaneous map-specific buffs/debuffs, the stats and skills of enemy ships, etc.

Important note: any bonus points to the ASW stat gained from gear, skills, Meowfficers, or Fleet Tech does NOT affect your Scan Range.

you will earn <color=#92fc63>2</color>shrine visit attempts, up to a maximum of <color=#ff5c5c>14</color>.
2. While having shrine visit attempts, you can spend 5 Coins
to make an offering for various buff effects.
Possible wishes and their effects are as follows:
Academic Success: Slightly reduced learning time in the Tactical Class
Career Success: Your fleets deal slightly increased damage in Main Campaign, Hard Mode, and War Archives stages.
Marital Bliss: Increases the rate your secretary ship gains Affection. 
All these buffs last for one day.
3. When obtaining the Academic Success buff, any classes
currently in session will not have their time reduced, nor will
the learning time increase if the buff wears off while a class
is in session.
4. If you make an offering while already having a buff effect,
the newly obtained buff will overwrite your previous one,
and the buff duration will be reset.
5. Only one buff effect can be active at a time.]]

-Short Summary: 
After you've cleared chapter 4 of the Operation Siren story, the following things will happen at server reset on the <color=#92fc63>1st</color> day of each month:
1. The state of all secured zones will reset. 
2. Your Action Points will reset and your ships will have any installed Adaptive Tuning removed. 
3. Items used exclusively in Operation Siren will be reset, with some of them being converted into Supply Shop Vouchers. 

The following items are available in the Operation Siren store: 
1. Operation Siren Data Logger. Costs <color=#92fc63>5,000 Oil</color>. 
2. A myriad of helpful items and resources. Purchased using Supply Shop Vouchers.

The Operation Siren Data Logger can be used from the Items menu. Doing so will grant you a lot of assorted Operation Siren items and resources and also lifts the movement restrictions between zones. 

-Reset Prerequisite:
After you have cleared chapter 4 of the Operation Siren story, the entire Operation Siren map will return to its original state on the <color=#92fc63>1st</color> of each month at server reset time. 
Once the reset occurs, you will be redirected to the main Operation Siren menu.
 Any fleets deployed at this time will be returned to Liverpool.

 -Things Affected by the Reset:
 1: All Zones 
When the OPS reset occurs, all zones you've secured will reset. After the reset, you can earn Zone Control Rewards from securing a zone once more.You will keep any stars you've earned for a zone, as these do not reset. Exploration bonuses do not reset either.

After the reset, a new item called the Operation Siren Data Logger will be available for purchase in the store. Once you've purchased it, you can use it from the Operation Siren Items menu to instantly unlock all zones and receive all the rewards for securing them. 

Using the Operation Siren Data Logger will award you the following items:
Adaptive Tuning-Offense <color=#92fc63>(90 pcs)</color> 

Adaptive Tuning-Survivability <color=#92fc63>(90 pcs)</color> 

Adaptive Tuning-Tactics <color=#92fc63>(90 pcs)</color>

Emergency Repair Pack<color=#92fc63> (45 pcs)</color>

Action Point Refill (S) <color=#92fc63>(45 pcs) </color>

Operation Supply Coins<color=#92fc63> (84,000 pcs)</color>

Note: The Operation Siren Data Logger will NOT award any random drops that are gained through defeating enemies.

2: All Modifiers to Your Operation Siren Fleets 

All your ships active in Operation Siren will have their HP, status modifiers, and Adaptive Tuning reset to the default.

Your Action Points will also reset, starting you off with <color=#92fc63>200 AP.</color>

- Comf-Forts Info:

1. You can leave your Meowfficers in Comf-Forts to passively grant them EXP over time, much like with shipgirls in the Dormitory.
Once a day, you may perform the following actions once each with Meowfficers assigned in your Comf-Forts:
- Clean
- Play
- Feed
The benefits of whichever action is chosen is then applied to all Meowfficers in all Comf-Forts.
Putting a new Meowfficer in a Comf-Fort which was the target for one of these actions will not let you redo the actions, nor can you do them again if you take a Meowfficer that was the target for one of these actions and put it into a Comf-Fort that went unused.The benefits of the action you chose will then be applied to the Comf-Fort with the Meowfficer assigned, and that action will become unavailable for the rest of the day.

2. The benefits of these actions are as follows:
- Clean: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts.
- Play: grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and you have a chance to receive Cat Box Quick Finishers.
- Feed: Grants upgrade points for your Comf-Forts, and increases the EXP your Meowfficers earn in their Comf-Forts.

Upgrading your Comf-Forts will give you access to additional Comf-Fort slots, Comf-Fort themes, and increase the EXP your Meowfficers earn while in a Comf-Fort.]]

a) Weekly Missions - Missions unlocked in batches every 7 days during the campaign season, for a total of 8 batches.
b) Seasonal Missions - One set of missions available for the entire campaign season, available from the start of the season.
· All of the above Season Missions are automatically active, and when you open the Season Missions menu, you will automatically obtain Progress Pts. for any missions you've completed.
· If you purchase a Fair Winds Cruise Pass, you will automatically receive 15 levels worth of progress (1500 Progress Pts).
· You can receive rewards for reaching certain Progress milestones. There are two types of rewards:
a) Cruise Rewards - Rewards that can be obtained based on the total number of accumulated Progress Pts. There are a total of 100 levels.
b) Fair Winds Rewards - An additional set of rewards that will be unlocked when you purchase a Fair Winds Cruise Pass. As with the regular Cruise Rewards, there are a total of 100 levels, and they can be collected alongside Cruise Rewards at the same Progress level.
· When the campaign season ends, your Progress Pts will be reset.

- Tips - 
· Play at your own pace
Cruise Missions have a total of 100 Progress levels, and are not meant to be cleared in one session. We recommend that you complete them at your own pace.

· Fair Winds Cruise Pass
If. you purchase a Fair Winds Cruise Pass from Akashi's shop, you will automatically earn 1500 Progress Pts and unlock access to valuable rewards. Furthermore, there is an exclusive outfit available only through the Fair Winds rewards, so please plan accordingly.

· Skipping Missions (not recommended)
You can purchase and use Cruise Mission Vouchers to automatically complete missions and receive the corresponding amount of Progress Pts. Tap the arrow button next to a mission on the Mission List to automatically complete it.
We do not recommend this because this costs Gems, whereas you are able to complete Cruise Missions normally.
Any purchased Cruise Mission Vouchers will remain even after the campaign season ends.]]

a) Weekly Missions - Missions are unlocked in batches every 7 days during the campaign season, for a total of 8 batches.
b) Seasonal Missions - One set of missions doable for the entire campaign season, available from the start of the season.
· All of the above Season Missions are automatically active, and when you open the Season Missions menu, you will automatically obtain Progress Pts. for any missions you've completed.
· If you purchase a Fair Winds Cruise Pass, you will automatically receive 15 levels worth of progress (1,500 Progress Pts).

b) Fair Winds Rewards - An additional set of rewards that will be unlocked when you purchase a Fair Winds Cruise Pass. As with the regular Cruise Rewards, there are a total of 100 levels, and they can be collected alongside Cruise Rewards at the same Progress level.
· When the campaign season ends, your Progress Pts. will reset.

- Dossier Analysis Overview -
The Dossier Analysis feature allows you to <color=#92fc63>rebattle past META ships</color> and gain Sync Points for them.
If you previously fought but didn't recruit a META ship that has been added to the Dossier Analysis, the Sync Points you gained for her carries over.

- Dossier Coordinate Data -
Dossier Coordinate Data is obtainable through Operation Siren. It is required to initiate a META Showdown against a past META ship.
· You can obtain up to <color=#92fc63>200</color> data every day. Data below the cap that went unused will carry over into the next day.
· It costs <color=#92fc63>100</color> data to initiate a Showdown against a past META ship.

- Setting and Changing Analysis Targets -
Once you've unlocked a META ship's dossier on the Dossier Analysis screen, you may initiate a Showdown against her.
· You may freely switch to another META ship if you want to analyze her dossier instead.

- Dossier Analysis Showdowns -
Your first attempt at a Showdown does not cost Oil. Your Oil cost decreases with each subsequent attempt, starting at <color=#92fc63>40</color> and eventually reaching <color=#92fc63>0</color>.
Showdowns initiated via Dossier Analysis do not count toward the daily cap on ordinary META Showdowns.
· You gain Sync Points for the META ship you're after once her HP reaches 0.
· A Showdown remains active for 24 hours. If you do not finish it within this time, you will have to reinitiate the fight.
· Dossier Analysis Showdowns have a fixed Corrosion Level of 15.

- Support in Dossier Analysis Showdowns -
Friends and members of the same Guild who have unlocked Dossier Analysis can assist each other during Showdowns.
<color=#92fc63>Assisting a friend or guildmate does not yield any rewards, but neither does it cost Oil nor consume your daily Showdown attempts.</color>
· Up to 30 players may participate in the same Showdown.

- Showdown Combat Overview -
Much like with ordinary META Showdowns, submarines and Meowfficers cannot participate in Dossier Analysis Showdowns.
Shipgirls taking part in the Showdown do not gain EXP, but they also do not lose Morale.
You cannot stop a battle once it has begun. If the game is exited at any point during the battle, one of the following penalties is applied:
· If you are the Showdown's initiator, any spent Oil is not reimbursed, and all your damage dealt in that battle is negated.
· If you are assisting another player, all your damage dealt in that battle is negated.

- Auto-Deploy Overview -
After you've initiated a Dossier Analysis Showdown and completed the first attempt, the Auto-Deploy feature becomes available for the rest of that Showdown.
The Oil cost of running Auto-Deploy is based on how much damage you dealt to the META ship on the first attempt. This damage is used to calculate how many battles it will take to defeat the META ship and, subsequently, the total Oil cost of those battles.
· Using Auto-Deploy costs the same amount of Oil as fighting the META ship manually, with an Oil cap of 200.
· Auto-Deploy will automatically defeat the META ship in 15 minutes unless you disable it manually. Doing so does not reimburse the spent Oil and all your damage dealt is negated.]]

- Manjuu Ice Cream Overview -
Match the correct toppings and ice cream flavors with what the customers order by tapping on the ingredients. Matching correctly scores you points. Try to get as high a score as possible before the timer runs out.
Play the minigame for 7 days during the event to receive a special chat frame.

- How to Play -
1. Customers appear and ask for a particular combination of flavors and toppings.
2. Tap the correct ingredients on the bottom of the screen to create their desired ice cream. The ice cream will be handed to them after you've chosen the same number of ingredients as they ask for, then you'll receive a new order.
3. Your score and the customer's reaction depend on if you got their order correct or not. How long it took you to pick the toppings and flavors and if they were the right ones or not also influence your score.
4. The minigame ends once the timer reaches 0 or when you quit the game early.

- Combo Bonuses -
· When you get a customer's order exactly right, there is a chance that the countdown timer for the next ice cream order will move slower for 4 seconds. This bonus cannot activate again until 5 seconds after it expires.
· When you get 2 orders exactly right in a row, 2 seconds will be added to the next order countdown timer.
· When you get 2 orders exactly right in a row from the same customer, you gain twice as many points from the next customer. This bonus can only activate once per unique customer.]]

The materials can be used to improve the buildings around the campus, granting your whole fleet special benefits for the duration of the event.
Each building provides a different benefit, and they can each be upgraded to level 3. The higher the building's level, the better the benefit it provides.
The following buildings on the Manjuu Campus can be upgraded:
· Manjuu Schoolhouse
· Manjuu School Shops
· Manjuu Stage
· Manjuu Fortune Teller

The Operation: Patisserie minigame is also available during this event.
Every day, you will automatically receive 1 Minigame Point. You can store up to 7 points. Finishing the minigame will subtract 1 point, if you have any, and grant you a reward at the end of the minigame.

- Operation: Patisserie Overview -
See what the manjuus want to order, then pick out the correct dessert from the left side of the screen by tapping on it.
Completing orders correctly scores you points. Try to get as high a score as possible before the timer runs out.
You'll receive a reward at the end of the minigame if you have at least 1 Minigame Point.
Play the minigame over 7 days to receive various rewards, including a New Year's Invitation (2024).

- How to Play -
1. Before the game starts, you must select a Main and Sub shipgirl to bring over the desserts.
2. Tap a dessert on the table on the left side of the screen to instruct your shipgirls to fetch it.
3. After a shipgirl has picked up a dessert, tap one of the manjuus at the center of the screen to serve the dessert.
4. Serving the correct dessert scores 1 point for your team. Serving the wrong dessert subtracts 1 point.
5. The Sub shipgirl you select serves desserts on her own, just like the CPU team you're playing against (using the table on the right side).
6. The minigame ends when the timer hits 0. The team with the most points wins.

Every Main and Sub shipgirl has a unique trait. Choose your team wisely!]]

In the "Fu Shun's Great Adventure IV" minigame, your goal is to control Fu Shun's chibi and collect food dishes indicated by the Target displayed onscreen, avoiding dangerous Nianjuus in the process.
A new stage will be unlocked every day until <color=#92fc63>1/24</color>. Clear all 7 stages to obtain the destroyer, Fu Shun.

How to Play:
1) You can move Fu Shun by using the joypad at the bottom left-hand side of the screen. Use the buttons on the bottom right-hand side of the screen to use various skills and items.

2) Earn points by collecting the item indicated by the "Target" displayed onscreen. The game ends when the timer runs out, or you quit the game.

3) Tap on the "Settings" button to use your accumulated score to unlock and equip skills and items.

4) Upon starting a stage, you will be able to view the abilities of the Nianjuus appearing on that stage. Disabling certain Nianjuu abilities will make the game easier, but also reduces your score potential.

5) In each stage, Nianjuus have different abilities, and the score multiplier that can be attained from each stage differs as well.

Coalition Battle Event: Frostfall
Event Period: <color=#92fc63>3/23/2023 - 4/5/2023</color>

Overview:
During the "Frostfall" event, you will form multiple fleets to challenge special event stages, and collect event points to earn great rewards.
Accumulating a certain number of event points will allow you to collect milestone rewards.
By tapping the "Sortie" button on the event banner, you will be taken to the event stages.

How to Play:
1. On the event page, you can toggle between the story content and the combat stages by tapping on the Intel/Combat tabs on the bottom left-hand side of the screen.
2. On the Combat Prep interface, form a fleet to challenge a special event stage. After clearing one difficulty, you will unlock the subsequent difficulty.
3. Stages beyond Easy difficulty will feature multiple battles during a single sortie.
4. While sortieing, you may configure and sortie as many fleets as corresponding to the number of battles in that stage. The number of sortie fleets can be toggled between "Solo Challenge" and "Coalition Battle" on the Combat Prep interface.
During Solo Challenge, one fleet will fight against all the battles in that stage.
During Coalition Battle, you will have to configure multiple fleets for each battle, and each fleet will take turns fighting in the corresponding battles.
5. Completing all the battles in a stage will be considered clearing the stage, and you will earn event points. You will earn additional rewards for clearing a stage through a Coalition Battle.
6. Easy, Normal, and Hard stages cost Oil, and there is no limit to the number of times they may be attempted. The SP stage may be played once per day. There is no limit to the number of times the EX stage may be attempted, but clearing it will not award event points. The Oil Limit and Auto-Repeat features are available in certain stages.
7. Accumulate event points to unlock milestone rewards and new story chapters in the Intel mode.
8. Unlock all story chapters to get a piece of limited gear.

- Event Overview - 
Uncharted Summer is an event filled with activities centered around Seabreeze Island. Explore the island, gather Adventure Coins, and earn various rewards!
This event is split up into 2 parts – the Adventure Map, and your Base Camp.
Adventure Map – explore the island and play minigames to get Adventure Coins, which can be traded for rewards in the shop.
Base Camp – use the resources you found on the island to expand your camp and craft items to receive rewards and open up new areas to explore.

- Base Camp Details -
Your Base Camp has various icons which can take you to more specific camp features.
It can also be leveled up, providing buffs to your whole fleet for the duration of the event.
To increase your camp's level, use your Crafting Station to make items to upgrade your buildings using the materials you found while exploring.
After you've upgraded your buildings sufficiently, the camp will level up on its own. You can check your current Base Camp level at the Mission Board.

- Specific Functions -
1. The Crafting Station
Here you can use the materials found while exploring or brought back by the Expedition Squad to create exclusive furniture and items used around your Base Camp.
Upgrading your Crafting Station gives you access to a wider range of items to craft.

2. The Expedition Squad
Once a day, your Expedition Squad will automatically collect materials for you.
The amount of materials the squad brings back is dependent on your Expedition Squad's level as well as the level of certain other buildings.

3. Manjuu Papercraft
Here you can create gifts for your shipgirls using the materials you've gathered and the items you've made at the Crafting Station.
The shipgirls will reciprocate your gift and give you rewards such as materials and Adventure Coins.

4. The Mission Board
The Mission Board has a list of missions you can complete, earning you Adventure Coins and other rewards for your efforts.
You can also check the Records to see how far into the story you are and how much of the island you've explored. As you fill in the pages, you'll get hints showing you where to find hidden treasure chests on the Adventure Map.

5. The Dining Area and Living Quarters
Upgrading these buildings will raise your Base Camp level in addition to increasing the number of rewards your Expedition Squad can bring back.

1. Use the control stick on the bottom left side of the screen to move Akashi around.
2. Reach the top side of the screen, approach the ore on the ground, and tap the Move button to carry the ore.
· You can pick up more than one ore, but only up to a certain weight. Once you hit this threshold, you can't carry more.
· When you become over-encumbered with ore, your movement speed drops.
3. Once you reach the ramp on the bottom side of the screen, you can drop off the ore. Doing so will give you points.
4. Colliding with any of the manjuus passing through the middle of the screen makes you lose all the ore you're carrying.

- Overview -
During The Spiriting-Away Incident? mini-event, there are rewards you can earn by playing the minigame to earn Youkai Talismans which can be traded for rewards. You will also gain clearing rewards from finishing cases.
A new case will be unlocked every day up to September 20th. Finishing every case will unlock the endless mode.
This mini-event is available between <color=#92fc63>September 14th and October 4th, 23:59</color>.

- Rewards -
1. Using the Youkai Talismans you earned from playing the minigame, you can exchange for items in the shop, such as limited furniture, gear skin boxes, and new characters to use in the minigame.
2. You receive 1 gear skin box the first time you clear each case of the minigame. Additionally, you'll also receive an Onsen Note, used to level up the Open-Air Onsen, the first time you clear cases 1, 3, 5, and 7.
3. Completing the 7th case will award you the exclusive furniture Aoandon.

- How to Play -
· Tap and hold on the minigame screen to fire talismans using your chosen character.
Once a talisman hits the youkai procession, it will add a youkai of the same color as the talisman to the procession; line up three youkai of the same color to repel them.
· Youkai will slowly come in from off the screen and follow the line until they reach the end goal.
The game ends either when you've repelled enough youkai that no more come in, or when the youkai reach the end goal.
· There are three play modes: regular cases (7 in total), a one-time special case (the interlude), and endless mode, where youkai will keep appearing indefinitely.
· Once a day, you will gain a minigame ticket.
When you complete the minigame while in possession of a minigame ticket, the ticket will be lost and you'll gain 150 Youkai Talismans.
All cases will give you their rewards only once until you complete the final, 7th case.
Once you complete the 7th case, you can receive Youkai Talismans from all play modes (including endless mode.)
· The amount of Youkai Talismans you receive from endless mode is based on your high score.
· You can unlock additional playable characters in the shop: Yura, Shinano, and Shimakaze.
· Each character has her own active and passive skills. The active skill can be engaged by tapping the button on the bottom of the screen.
· Achieving certain character-specific feats and completing missions in the minigame will reward you with Youkai Talismans.]]

- Overview -
This event is available between November 3rd and November 15th.
Complete the event missions, investigate the castle, and unlock story chapters to receive various exploration rewards, including the limited furniture, Dice of Destiny.

· How to Investigate
On the A Bump in the Rainy Night event banner, there are event missions for sinking enemy ships. Each time you complete one, you receive one Die Roll.
You can then tap the button on the bottom right of the event banner to move around the castle and investigate. On the investigation screen, you may use your Die Rolls to unlock new areas to search for clues.
Tapping on a searchable area will initiate the story.

Your rolls on the investigation screen can end in either success or failure. When your roll succeeds, you unlock 2 new searchable areas, while if it fails, you only unlock 1.
Different story events will play out depending on where you investigate. If you get a game over, you will automatically be returned to the point you were before. This will not count as a Die Roll, and you can try for a roll even if you have 0 attempts.

You will unlock rewards based on the amount of areas you have investigated, such as the limited furniture, Dice of Destiny.
After you have read the whole story, you unlock the character creation function which lets you create a profile for your investigator.

· Character Creation
Finishing the whole story will unlock the character creation function.
Here, you can input a name to generate a random investigator's profile.

- Rehearsal Overview -

Complete event missions and clear event stages to earn <color=#92fc63>Harmonious Emblems</color>, which can be used to initiate rehearsals.
Check back regularly to see if you've collected enough for another rehearsal.

There are 3 types of rehearsal, each granting a different bonus.
Additionally, your rehearsal level for a given category increases as you perform it again. Maxing out your rehearsal level will award you an additional bonus at the end.

The 3 rehearsal types are as follows:
1. Vocal Appeal - Increases the DMG your ships deal in battle.
2. Glamorous Steps - Decreases the DMG your ships take in battle.
3. Memorable Performance - Increases the EXP your ships gain in battle.

If you're not sure what your current rehearsal level is, you can check it from the right-hand-side of the event banner.]]
